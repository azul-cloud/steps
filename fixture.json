I started the year off leaving everything behind with the intention of long-term travel. I am ending the year being confused as hell as to what I\u2019m going to be doing in the future, but with many ideas in mind. One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that with flexibility comes uncertainty. My plans have slowly turned into ideas, and they change almost daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started the year off with the intention of finding a way to live a sustainable life while traveling. Having a travel blog and various options that arise when obtaining a large audience was what I first attempted. Within a few months I realized better opportunities awaited me, and this blog became a personal hobby, dropping from my priority list. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began getting heavier into web development while living in Medellin Colombia, and launched my second project Travel Blog Source. Above everything else, I love doing web development. I did it for free for many months, just because I enjoy it. It was a great idea, and I still believe with the right dedication the idea would work. However, when it came time to do the marketing, I lost interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 4 months in Colombia, it was time to leave. I headed south, even though my heart was not all the way in it. My time in Ecuador was not the best month of my life, and I quickly re-learned the ups and downs of traveling. Luckily enough, I was not tied to anything, and I moved onto Peru after spending a month in the mountain regions of Ecuador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My stay in Peru was more extended that I had planned. This is when I learned that my travel plans are never concrete. I picked up a client for web development within the first weeks in Peru, and it was a project that interested me, a lot. I spent about a month in Peru doing some touristy-ish stuff in northern Peru, but by the time I got into Lima it was dedication time. I spent those two months working hard, earning good money that would sustain me for a ridiculous amount of time traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had found it. A beautiful life hack. Finally I had achieved the ultimate goal, obtaining a US income while living abroad. Not only is it just about the income, it is something that I thoroughly enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within three days of being in Lima, I had a revelation. At this point I was very tired of traveling solo. The thought of continuing along my route into Bolivia, Argentina and Chile made me sick to my stomach. I wanted something stable, I was tired of living from my backpack at that point. I was desperately missing my Colombian life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to visa reasons, I stayed in Peru for 3 months before heading back to Colombia via boat in the amazon jungle. After all, just flying from Lima to Medellin would be too easy right? I took the hard route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got back into Colombia, and headed back to Medellin after spending a few days in the amazonian town of Leticia. However, my time was limited and I left after just a couple weeks. I headed back down to the coffee region where I have spent the last couple months. Before heading back to the United States, I\u2019m going to spend a couple weeks in Bogota and Tunja to see some friends and Colombian family.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Top 3 Highlights of Year 1</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><h4>Two months in Medellin</h4><p>My time in Medellin was definitely the highlight for me. In those months I became fluent in Spanish, learned how to dance Salsa, Merengue, Bachata and Vallenato to a point where I feel comfortable, and I learned what an awesome city Medellin is.</li>\r\n<li><h4>Colombian Tourism</h4><p>Having the privilege of getting to know so many places in Colombia has been quite the opportunity. In the future I would love to do something with tourism in this country, because it is something I\u2019m very passionate about. Showing people this beautiful land is something that I am looking forward to.</p></li>\r\n<li><h4>Mountains of Ecuador and Peru</h4><p>I must say, the mountains of these two countries were incredible. There are some places I want to go back to, and there is still so much more to explore.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Plans</h3>\r\n<p>So you might be wondering, what\u2019s next?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, in a few words, I really don\u2019t know. However, I have a plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m heading back to the US in a week. I\u2019m going to spend about two months working in Seattle with the client which I have been working remotely with since February, and then probably a few weeks doing other things such as visiting friends and family, hiking, camping, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then in either October I\u2019m going to head back to Colombia for at least a few months. I\u2019ll probably spend some time back in the Coffee Region and Medellin before heading up to the northern caribbean coast to knock Taganga and La Guajira off the list of places I still need to visit in Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, the travel bug is going to hit me again. I\u2019ll either fly down into patagonia in southern Argentina and Chile and make my way up Chile and Argentina until reaching Bolivia and Southern Peru or I'll head to Brazil and learn portuguese. Still undecided. After that, who knows. I\u2019ll make my way to wherever my little heart desires at the time, which I\u2019m guessing will be back to my beloved Colombia!</p>\r\n", "category": 5, "views": 340, "headline": "What a year it has been", "image": "blogposts/oneyear_1.png", "title": "One Year in South America", "img_alt": "Travel South America", "post_date": "2014-06-21", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Travel South America"}}, {"pk": 35, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>I had heard from many people who enjoyed taking the boat trips throughout parts of the Amazon River ranging from Iquitos Peru all the way to Manaus Brazil. After seeing the expensive flights going from Lima to Medellin, I found that flying to Iquitos, taking a boat to Leticia Colombia, and then taking a plane to Medellin was about half the price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add in the opportunity to finally go to the Amazon, and it seemed like a win-win situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A few days in Iquitos</h3>\r\n<p>I flew out to Iquitos and immediately started looking for boats to Leticia but they were hard to come by due to Semana Santa (Easter week). I had to endure three days in Iquitos before I found a boat leaving out of Iquitos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point I desperately wanted to be in Colombia. My last month in Peru was pretty much full of not wanting to be there and just waiting to go back to Colombia. The full reason why I had to wait is complicated, but it was for visa reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a hard time sleeping the night before leaving. The night before going to Colombia for me is always like an 8 year old trying to sleep on Christmas Eve. I tossed and turned pretty much all night until finally my alarm went off at 4:45. I\u2019ve never been so excited for an alarm that early in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made my way to the dock on a mototaxi went through some inspection stuff and then loaded onto the boat. People began to fill the boat and there were two girls somewhere between the ages of 8 and 10 taking pictures with their mom or aunt who was on the boat. I remember those two girls and I have a huge soft spot for latin american kids. They\u2019re ridiculously cute.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Journey on the Amazon</h3>\r\n<p>Finally we left for the 10 hour journey along the Amazon stretching from Iquitos to Leticia. I was pumped. I had waited seemingly forever and by the time I got off that boat I would be in Santa Rosa Peru which is pretty much Colombia being only 2 minutes away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my friends had suggested to take the plane because he liked the views better and it was a similar price for just a 1 hour flight. About an hour into the trip, I understood why. I had wanted to take a boat just to say I had taken a boat along the Amazon, but the landscapes were the same for hour after hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 2 hours into the trip we had a big thud that stopped the boat and broke the propeller. We hit one of the trees that were laden throughout the river. For a few seconds it seemed like we were sinking but after about 15 seconds I was convinced we were ok. At this point it was pouring down rain while the 2 crew members worked to replace the propeller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought to myself, what happens if they can\u2019t get it fixed? I would have been so upset having to go back to Iquitos for another day and trying to find a boat or plane again. Luckily, that didn\u2019t happen and we were able to continue along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were some russians on the boat, and some type of foreigners in front of me, but everyone else looked amazonian either from Peru, Colombia or Brazil. That included a girl in the front of the boat who had some quite amazing eyes. We made eye contact many many times and each time I became quite distracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We continued along the river for many hours and I was following along on the GPS trying to entertain myself by guessing where we would be at certain time intervals and judging when we would arrive to our final destination. Yes, I\u2019m weird like that, but what else is there to do? :)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>And then it happened</h3>\r\n<p>From my calculations we would have arrived into Leticia at 4:30, and there was only an hour left in the journey. I thought about maybe trying to sleep to speed things up, but it wasn\u2019t working. Things were going really smooth just after our 2nd huge pourdown of rain during the trip. Everything was completely smooth and the people on the boat were quiet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then all of a sudden out of nowhere we flipped up onto our side in one fluid motion. For a split second it seemed like maybe we would go on our side but would recover and be fine. However, when water started gushing in through the windows on my side of the boat, within a couple seconds I knew there was no chance of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously on the boat trip I had thought about something like this happening when our propeller broke and I briefly thought we were sinking. After the boat began to fill, I remember thinking to myself, \u201cwow, this is really happening\u201d. I then heard the boat driver shout something like \u201cEveryone get out of the boat\u201d.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really only remember about 3 seconds of being in the boat before going under water. After I realized what was happening and heard the captain shout, I remember fully submerging myself, briefly searching for the window and then getting out of it as quickly as I could. I swam up and reached surface and saw the boat slowly moving from being on it\u2019s side to having its stern fully in the water and turning vertical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything for the next few minutes was quite crazy and I could not think very clearly. At that point survival instincts took full control. After popping up in the water and looking for shore, it was far. Very, very, very far. We were at one of the widest parts of the river that I had seen, and we were directly in the middle. I\u2019m a good swimmer and I knew I could probably make it to the shore if needed, but then what? I would have been in the middle of the jungle and would have had to channel my inner Bear Grylls. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up staying by the boat bow which ended up staying afloat for way longer that I had expected. Unfortunately all the life jackets were stuck in the boat and going back in the boat underwater would be quite risky. For someone like me who was a good swimmer, it was not worth the risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then we started to realize that some of us were not there. There were two people who definitely did not know how to stay calm under pressure. One of them was a lady and the other one was a man. The lady started screaming about that there were two kids still in the boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, at this point it was so hard to think clearly. In my head, I would never have known who was in the boat or who was outside, all I was thinking about was saving my energy in case we needed to swim to shore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, I couldn\u2019t even remember the kids even though just an hour earlier the little girl was playing with her sister or aunt in the seat next to me. She was super cute and I wanted to take a picture with her, but never did. I didn\u2019t even realize that she didn\u2019t make it out until later that night while trying to sleep, even though there was much talk about two children not making it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back at the situation, I only have one thing I would change. I didn\u2019t know the boat bow would stay afloat for 30 minutes. If I had known that I definitely would have attempted to help people out, but I would not have fully gone into the boat. Next time, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometime in the next 15 minutes we saw something in the window at the front of the boat. With this water it was hard to see a couple inches, but there was definitely something. We were able to open the front window and then someone came out. But it was a corpse. Someone attempted CPR, but at some point it was determined that she wasn\u2019t able to be saved. I then realized, that was the girl I was exchanging eye contact with on the boat ride. This was also the girl that was taking pictures with the kids at the dock in Iquitos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2019s when it really hit me. People died. Her body was floating right by us. That was the heaviest part of the whole situation. We tied her wrist to a part of the boat so she wouldn\u2019t drift off and then continued trying to get attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Rescue</h3>\r\n<p>Finally after about 15 or 20 minutes we saw a boat going by. It was far away but we were yelling and flailing about hopefully they would see us. I noticed I was wearing my bright yellow Colombia soccer jersey so I made sure to keep as much of my torso above the water as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It worked. We were able to get the attention of the tour boat and it changed its course and came directly for us. What a relief that was. I personally didn\u2019t think we would be seeing any boats, especially before the bow of the boat was beneath water and we needed to swim. At this point I any chance of not making it out alive was gone. Losing everything was still a sour idea, but it could have been worse. Really nothing else mattered except for being alive and being able to enjoy the rest of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point around this time, I saw a black bag floating. I swam closer to it and confirmed, yes, that was my bag! Without my bag, I wouldn\u2019t have had any shoes or any clothes except for what was on my back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, I had my James Rodriguez jersey on, which is the most important part of my wardrobe :) That shirt is very significant for me and represents a lot of the love I have for Colombia. Now, it is even that much more special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, after the boat arrived they told us there was no room, which was actually true although some people decided to act harshly when they said that, myself include :) They stuck around with us and within 5 to 10 more minutes we were able to wave down two more tour boats who did have room. There were people, bags, and the one body that split up between the three boats and then all headed towards Leticia which was still about an hour away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\r\n<p>After getting into Leticia, we were dropped off at the dock of the Colombian Coast Guard. There were Colombian Coast Guard, Peruvian Coast Guard, a couple emergency rescue teams, and a few police there ready to greet us. They began getting our names, age and nationalities trying to see how many people survived and how many people were still missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, there were 15 survivors including the crew and there were 5 people who did not make it out. I met a guy in my hostel in Leticia who works for Colombia Reports and we went and found out some more information in the next couple days. The Coast Guard ended up finding the body of a pregnant woman, but there were still three bodies missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We waited there for things to get sorted out and for bags to arrive. Everyone was obviously very curious of what happened so we spent most of the time explaining the story and theorizing why we flipped. I had to ask about three times \u201cso what are we waiting for now?\u201d Sometimes there was an answer and sometimes there was not. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After immigration showed up and figured out who was staying in Colombia and who was leaving, there wasn\u2019t anything else to wait for. Except for my bag. Myself and an Indian guy\u2019s bags were still missing but were supposedly accounted for at a resort upstream. We had been waiting for the bags to be delivered for around 45 minutes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally the suspense was over and the waterlogged bags were returned to us and it was time to go. The commander of the Colombian Coast Guard in that region ended up giving me a ride into town and dropped me off at the immigration office where a couple very friendly immigration workers met up with me and helped me find a place to stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolling up to the hostel in the immigration SUV created much curiosity for the hostel guests. They got all excited and thought I had been interrogated or had been smuggling drugs or something like that. They asked me something like \u201cso how did it go in the interrogation room?\u201d I told them It\u2019s better than that and I\u2019ll tell you later while I continued walking to see if there was a bed available, and there ended up being one left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got everything into the hostel hung up and drying before making my way back out to the front to tell the people staying in the hostel the full story. They were shocked. The story blew away what they had been thinking. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, I was just happy to be alive, in Colombia and drinking some refreshing Aguila (a Colombian beer). Finally I had made it to Colombia, although this time it was in a manner that I will never forget.</p>\r\n", "category": 5, "views": 383, "headline": "I had heard from many people who enjoyed taking the boat trips throughout parts of the Amazon River", "image": "blogposts/amazon.jpg", "title": "Tragedy on the Amazon", "img_alt": "Boat on the Amazon", "post_date": "2014-04-23", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Boat on the Amazon"}}, {"pk": 34, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<h1>The Early Times</h1>It's been a long journey. I'm approaching\u00a0nearly\u00a03 years since I first decided to focus on learning Spanish, and what an unexpected life-changing journey it has been.<br /><br />In the beginning I was spending all my time on Livemocha.com doing lessons and chatting with friends whom I met through the website. I was reading 5-6 spanish articles a day, trying to improve as much as I could each and every day. English music went out the window and was replaced with Spanish music. Everything changed.<br /><br />Days became weeks, and weeks became months. Now, months have become years.<br /><br />Slowly I began transitioning off the need for Google Translate. My conversations with people on Livemocha became more fluid. My typing improved every day as I absorbed more and more of the most beautiful language in the world.\u00a0<br /><br />After about the first year, I hardly had the need for Google Translate and I began to ask myself - am I fluent with typing and reading?<br /><br /><h1>The Levels of Fluency</h1>Well, the answer was no. Or was it yes? It's really a subjective question and depends on what people consider fluency.<br /><br />I knew I was not completely\u00a0<b>fluent</b>, In my head, that part was not debatable. I had so much work to do with speaking and listening because I didn't have as much opportunity to practice those parts of the language. However, my writing and reading was pretty damn close. I still needed to use Google Translate maybe once a day, but I was feeling good. I was feeling <b>fluent</b>.<br /><br />Looking back, I would not say I was fluent at that time with reading and writing. Nowadays I use Google Translate less than once a month for some obscure word that I have never seen before, and likely won't come up for a long time. I am now fluent, and I'm pretty sure a year from now I will agree with that statement.<br /><br />The speaking part of Spanish didn't come so quickly, and there were more questions on when I became fluent and even a small inkling of a doubt if I am\u00a0currently\u00a0fluent.<br /><br />At the beginning of my current <u>South America trip</u>, I knew I was not fluent. I was immersing myself day in and day out speaking Spanish and before the trip I had an idea that maybe after a month I would be able to consider myself fluent.<br /><br />I wouldn't say I achieved that in a month, or even two months. It took a solid 3 months before I began to consider myself fluent. There were many days when I wondered if I was fluent or not and as time progressed it became more difficult to say that I was not fluent. <br /><br />I began to make less errors. I began to talk quicker. I started receiving more and more compliments. &quot;Oh you're from the US? But why do you speak very good Spanish?&quot;. New accents became easier to understand (until I met Chilenos and Argentinos...).\u00a0<br /><br />Little by little I began to consider myself more fluent. <b>But what does that even mean</b>?\u00a0<br /><br /><h1>It's about a feeling\u00a0</h1>For the first time ever, while writing this article I have decided to turn to my trusty friend Google to get a definition of language fluency. It talks about reading, writing, comprehension, speaking, and reading comprehension. I've found examples such as easily read texts in the language, produce and understand speech, and formulate texts.<br /><br />As you can see, there's a lot of gray area. And for that reason, I have been confused for so long if I can consider myself fluent.<br /><br />That is, until now. I think there are a couple aspects of language that are\u00a0vastly overlooked. It is the <b>feeling </b>you have when using a language and it is how you <b>think </b>when using a language.<br /><br />To me these are by far the most important parts, and the determining factor in what I personally consider fluency.<br /><br />I have been able to fulfill some definitions of fluency for quite some time now - especially on the written side. However, I didn't have the feeling.<br /><br />Now when I speak Spanish, I don't need to think. My mind is completely at ease, and the words just flow out. I never have to translate anything and I have a harder time figuring out how to say things in English rather than how to say things in Spanish. <br /><br />When people talk to me in English I have to switch my brain over and it feels unnatural, albeit that feeling only lasts for about 5-10 seconds.\u00a0<br /><br />When I talk to myself in my head (or out loud sometimes, but that's a different story...) it is in Spanish. I used to get super excited when I had dreams in Spanish, but now I don't know whether I dream in Spanish or English - it's a mix of both.<br /><br />After I received that special feeling, I knew I could consider myself fluent. It's been quite a long road over the last 3 years, but it has been the best road I have ever been on.", "category": 3, "views": 638, "headline": "I've had many definitions while learning Spanish, but I think I have a final answer", "image": "blogposts/languages.jpg", "title": "What is language fluency?", "img_alt": "What is Language Fluency", "post_date": "2014-03-31", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "What is Language Fluency"}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<div>During my time in Huanchaco Peru, I had a revelation on the importance and value of time.</div><div><br /></div><div>My thoughts on the value of time were fueled after I started working on a new project in which I actually get paid.

When I got home from work and/or soccer, I would practice Spanish. When I listened to music at work, it was always in Spanish. When I read news, it was in Spanish. When I dreamt, sometimes it was in Spanish. For some reason I even switched my speedometer to kilometers, but that was a bit overboard and I returned to miles...</div><div><br /></div><div>My introduction to the value of time began for me around the age of 18 when I started to really get into competitive video games. One of my good friends and his brother for years had always been amazingly good at video games, way better than the rest of us. What was their secret? Well, there was a lot of skill involved which increases efficiency, but the secret to gaining that skill was dedication of time.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was under the impression that 5-6 hours a day would be sufficient, however, what stopped me from putting in 7-8 hours? Sometimes there are things that limit time such as school or friends, but it all depends on how you value your time and what you want to invest your time into.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wanted to become great. The competitive nature in me always wanted more. In college I constantly was able to increase my play time and become better and better. I was constantly grinding away, minimizing my time away, and maximizing efficiency while I was playing. During the weekdays I was playing anywhere varying from 8-12 hours and on the weekends I was able to put in around 12-17 hours. Holy smokes, right! Now <b>that</b> is dedication.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>However, as you can imagine, after a couple years I learned that that dedication was not what I wanted to dedicate myself to. Although I have to thank that period of my life, because it taught me the maximum possible level of dedication, as well as taught me the value of time.</div><div><br /><h1>How I handle time</h1>After those years with competitive gaming, I have hardly wasted any time. I've always been on the go and always spending my time on what I find to be important.\u00a0<br /><br />For a few months in the spring of 2011 I was working full-time, doing two classes for my MBA, coaching high-school soccer and teaching a fitness class once or twice a week. Those months were crazy, but I had learned how to manage time and work hard and efficiently. After those few months, I felt like I could take on anything and everything. I'm always up for a challenge.<br />\u00a0\u00a0</div><div>I went through phases of tennis where I would watch all the tennis I could and in my free time was down at the park hitting against the wall, playing with people down there, or practicing my serve. That phase only lasted for about 6-8 months, and then my time was taken over by the sport I had played my whole life - soccer. Following that, Spanish was the king and I limited soccer because Spanish became more important.</div><div><br /></div><div>The secret to all of this was what I learned in the beginning through video games. They introduced me to tru dedication and learning that anything is possible. I hardly wasted any time.</div><div><br /><h1>New thoughts on the value of time</h1>I think I've figured out a big part of why people in Latin America are so happy and fulfilled, and a substantial part of it has to do with how they value time.<br />\u00a0</div><div>Before I started working on my new project I would spend my days working on Travel Blog Source for about 4-6 hours, go to the beach, take naps and mosey around. I didn't mind how much time things took, and I certainly wasn't concerned about losing time. You see, my time over the past few months was not worth very much. In fact, it wasn't worth anything at all. For that reason I was able to do many things without any need for dedication and without what many people would consider stress.</div><div><br /></div><div>Think of yourself as a small restaurant owner on a tropical beach. I'm talking really small, a family restaurant which you've been working in since you were a child. People come in everyday and you get them their food in exchange for money. There are no plans of growth or expansion, it's just your family restaurant which was handed down to you from your parents, and you'll hand it down to your children. The money you make supports your family and you're content with that.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is not much value to time. You can walk around the beach, you can take naps, you can do nothing, you can chat for hours, and there's no loss. You're making maybe $30 per day profit which is plenty to support your family. Sure there are things you can't do, and there is not much opportunity, but what you have you cherish and you're happy staying as-is.</div><div><br /><h1>Finding the secret</h1>For some people, that sounds peachy. For myself, I need challenge. It would be hard for me to be content on the tropical beach selling food and drinks. I mean, I think we can admit it would be awesome for a while. But what about after a year?\u00a0<br />\u00a0</div><div>Different cultures look at this differently, and Americans are notorious for always wanting more. We have a certain competitive drive that is tough for other people to catch up with, and it is something that is in our blood and in our culture. Most of the time we lose sight of that drive because it is just part of us - but my eyes have been opened and I see how different we are. We think differently, we live differently.<br /><br /></div><div>There is a saying that goes &quot;the less someone has, the happier they are&quot;. This is something that I agree with for the most part, however it does have its flaws.</div><div><br /></div><div>The secret is value of time. When someone's time is not valuable and they don't have much opportunity to improve their situation, they are happy with what they have. The more opportunity and drive someone has, the more they want. You lose sight of what you have and focus on what you could have in the future.\u00a0</div><div><br /></div>There comes a time when you have to decide do you want to be great, or do you want to get by? Do you want to truly dedicate yourself to something? There's nothing wrong with getting by, it's the easier choice. There are many easy opportunities to get by, and they are not bad choices.<br /><br />A new goal I now have in my life is to be in a situation where my wealth grows without having to invest time. After accomplishing that goal, I would have financial goals taken care of, as well as significantly lowering the value of my time. It's not just about making money, it's about not <b>having </b>to make any more of it and freeing up time.<br /><br />In the business world, it's called making money while you sleep and these revenue streams are the best ones. Here's the million dollar question - how do I accomplish this goal? I have many options, and none of them involve taking an easy route. If they were easy, everyone would be rich, and no one would have to be great at what they do.", "category": 3, "views": 381, "headline": "How much is time really worth?", "image": "blogposts/timemoney_edited.jpg", "title": "Value of Time", "img_alt": "value of time", "post_date": "2014-03-06", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "value of time"}}, {"pk": 32, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>Honestly, the only reason I'm traveling is because I can only stay 6 months in Colombia. From the minute I stepped foot outside of Colombia, everything changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I have had a lot of time to think, and that thinking has resulted in my realization that I really don't want to continue south solo traveling. Solo traveling really isn't for me. I have so much flexibility, can make all decisions, can travel cheaply, but the memories and experiences just aren\u2019t the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, Lima would probably be the best place to cut off my trip. I could finish traeling from Lima south some other time. It really wouldn't be that bad, and I could bring along a special someone. I'd definitely enjoy that more than solo long-term traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began thinking about what if I return to Colombia tomorrow? I began looking at flights from Lima to Bogota or Medellin. I began looking at apartment postings in my beautiful Medellin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the thought alone of Colombia makes me giddy. I just got goosebumps writing that last sentence. Seriously, I have problems. The thought of going back to Colombia has consumed my thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the choices I have?</h3>\r\n<p>The way I see it, I have 3 choices. There are also a couple \"static\" things that are set in stone (albeit, soft stone). I can't plan on being in Colombia for more than 6 months. I will be in Colombia for the World Cup from mid-June until mid-July. I will be in the United States from late July until early September.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Option #1 - Return to Colombia now</h4>\r\n<p>I found a ticket in 4 days for just over $400. If I returned now, that puts me at just under 5 months in Colombia and I could return for December (the best month), and until June 30th of the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with this option is that I wouldn't get to fully experience Lima, and honestly it seems like the best place I've been to since I left Cali, Colombia. If I continue struggling to find a place to stay in Lima, I might go with this option. Oh man, I get excited just thinking about this option :)</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Option #2 - Return to Colombia in 1-3 months</h4>\r\n<p>Ok, I could stay in Lima for now. I continue searching for a place, and can stay here for a couple months. I would then return to Colombia in mid-April, stay for 3 months, and then return for 3 months later in the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why this is good is that it gives me 9 consecutive months in Colombia. That's a lot of time without having to leave, which would be amazing. Heavenly, one might say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another pro to this option is that I would get to fully experience Lima, and when I return in the future it would just be to visit and begin a trip from Lima south.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Option #3 - Continue my travel plans</h4>\r\n<p>Maybe I don't go back to Colombia early. Maybe I continue traveling south after spending a month in Lima. As of today, this option is definitely my last choice. Who knows how I will feel tomorrow though, I certainly don't.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thought of me leaving Lima and traveling all the way down to central Chile, over into Argentina and Uruguay just doesn\u2019t excite me. It\u2019s not what I want to do right now. I\u2019m \u201cfine\u201d in Lima, but continuing my travels south is looking bleak.</p>", "category": 5, "views": 483, "headline": "Having some serious thoughts about not continuing south.", "image": "blogposts/lima.jpg", "title": "Am I done traveling for now?", "img_alt": "Lima Peru", "post_date": "2014-02-15", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Lima Peru"}}, {"pk": 31, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<h3>First stop in Peru - Piura</h3>\r\n<p>Getting into Peru was about as easy as it gets. The luck-bug bit me hard - I got on a bus from Loja Ecuador to the border with Peru, and it just so happened that the bus continued through the border all the way to Piura, my final destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd heard bad stories about the Peru-Ecuador border and I was told to be careful and aware. In fact, I'd met a Belgian in Cuenca who had been robbed at knifepoint on the Peru side of the border and he ended up losing $600. Why you would carry $600 (and not even hide it is beyond me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossing the less-traveled mountain crossing was a totally different story. It took only about 5 minutes and was about as safe as can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently the beautiful scenery of Ecuador stopped at Loja. The bus-ride to the border was quite ugly, and frankly, depressing. It gave me the same feeling I get while driving through parts of eastern Oregon actually - full of desolation, nothingness, and completely dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got into Piura just after nightfall and had a taxi ride around to find a hostel. There wasn't anything that looked too promising, and after walking around the hostel district and checking out 4 hostels, I decided to pick one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad choice, however, they were all bad. The hostel I stayed at was the worst place I have ever stayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When showing me the room, I instantly noticed how hot it was, however the guy pointed out that there was a fan. Ok, that should be fine, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went back down, and I paid the $7 for the room. After going back up and checking out the ugly, dirty room, I tried to turn on the fan. It didn't work. I went back down to tell them that the fan didn't work, I couldn't sleep in that hot box, and that I needed my money back. They looked at each other and said I had already registered and paid so they couldn't give me my money back. I made some rude gestures and statements showing my displeasure, but they didn't seem to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After what I had seen of Piura on the first night, there was no way I was staying for any extended time. In fact, the next morning I decided to leave and head south to Trujillo. Twelve hours in Piura was more than sufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Trujillo/Huanchaco</h3>\r\n<p>The 6 hours from Piura to Trujillo was another 6 hours of nothingness, desolation and desert (besides passing through a town called Chiclayo). On the plus side, the bus was the best bus I had ever ridden in and was great for sleeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got into Trujillo and took a taxi down to a beach called Huanchaco - this time, I had done my research and found a good place I wanted to go to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as I got into Huanchaco my mood was lifted. The sunny beach town was something I desperately needed after Piura. I got in on a Sunday and the beach was absolutely packed full of Peruvians who were there to enjoy the weekend. It made for a good entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img'>\r\n<img alt='Huanchaco Peru Beach' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/huanchaco/huanchaco_skinny.jpg'/>\r\n<span>Beach town of Huanchaco</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The hostel I arrived to was in fact a good one, and the first thing I noticed was that the room was not scorching hot and I would actually be able to sleep there. YES!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combined with the great internet, and even better ambiance of the small beach town, Huanchaco was a great place to stay for a week or two and get some quality work done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Huanchaco was almost perfect. I stayed there 10 days and it not once rained, and was never cold. I wore flip-flops, shorts, and never needed a shirt the entire time. I never needed pants either, but I probably needed to find a different beach for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around Trujillo there are a couple ancient ruins from the people who lived there before the Incas overcame them. The most famous place to go to in Trujillo for tourists is a place called Chan Chan which is more or less a \"giant sand castle\".</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img'>\r\n<img alt='Chan Chan Ancient Ruins Peru' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/huanchaco/chanchan_skinny.jpg'/>\r\n<span>Ruins of Chan Chan</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking through the ruins of Chan Chan gave perspective to a totally different way of life. It's interesting how even before the Spanish arrived and ridded the Incas of all their power, the Incans had their own foreign people close to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time spent in Huanchaco was well worth it. It was a much needed break from some rough stays in Loja and Piura. But hey, not everywhere can be great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My plan was to head to Huaraz after Trujillo, but after all the good things people said about Cajamarca I needed to check it out.

I had heard from numerous people that Secret Garden Cotopaxi was their favorite hostel in South America, and I quickly learned why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feeling you get while at Secret Garden is hard to explain, but the words that come to mind are serenity, peace, and tranquility. Away from everything, Secret Garden offers a unique experience which is hard to find anywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img'>\r\n<img alt='' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador2/secretgarden.jpg'/>\r\n<span></span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Having beautiful views over the valley and vistas of 7 volcanoes from their property, they are located on prime grounds. Unfortunately, the three days I was there I never saw any of them - it was cloudy the entire time. Luckily I was still able to see the lower valley, which made the trip worth it. I can only imagine how beautiful it would have been with the volcanoes towering above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took a few hikes close to the cabin, however the main attraction was to climb the base of Cotopaxi. With some of the fellow hostel-mates we took a van into the national park of Cotopaxi and began our guided hike from the trailhead. Again, it was cloudy the entire time and we never were able to actually see the mountain. They say it actually is there though, and I think I trust them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we climbed up in the brisk mountain air starting at 15,000+ feet it began to hail. Some of the people I was with had never seen snow before, so I let them know that a little bit higher the hail would stop and it would begin to snow. Literally 20 steps later, I was a prophet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something that has always interested me is Latin American\u2019s fascination with snow. Sometimes fish fail to see the water, and after years, we fail to see the snow. It really is quite an amazing thing and that I've learned from the people who have never seen snow before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, we kept trudging our way up in the falling snow and inevitably a snowball fight broke out. If you're guessing that I started the snowball fight, you would be right. I also taught them how to make a snowman, and that kept us amused for about half an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After making our way up past a refuge, we arrived to the first glacier base at 5,000 meters (16,500ft+) before descending back down. As we made our way back down, the snow became rain and was far less enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ba\u00f1os</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days after arriving to Secret Garden Cotopaxi, it was time to continue south to a town called Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa, or Ba\u00f1os for short.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img'>\r\n<img alt='' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador2/banos.jpg'/>\r\n<span></span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside Monta\u00f1ita, Ba\u00f1os is one of the two major touristy areas in Ecuador. The streets are packed full of hostels, restaurants and souvenir shops and I quickly saw how tourism totally controls the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually I don't like touristy areas (the reason I didn't go to Monta\u00f1ita), however I had a good feeling about Ba\u00f1os. There are many activities such as rafting, rappelling, bungee, biking, hiking, and more. Sitting in a large river valley that cuts into the tall Ecuadorian mountains, Ba\u00f1os is not short on beautiful views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably my favorite activity there was when I went hiking up in the mountains and ended up losing myself - mostly on purpose. \r\n\r\n<p>However, after about 5 days in Ba\u00f1os, I was ready to leave. It was nice for a few days, but after walking around the whole city multiple times and doing the touristy activities that drew my attention, there wasn't much else to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cuenca</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing south, another 10 hours in bus awaited me. After the first few minutes in Cuenca, I knew I would be staying there for longer than a few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to admit, Cuenca was my favorite place in Ecuador - I can see why it is the most famous place for Americans to retire. The weather was nice there, a much needed break from the colder weather in northern and central Ecuador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was cleaner, more modern, and more organized than the other places I had been to in Ecuador. It kind of had a <b>small</b> feel of <a href='/post/10/first-impressions-of-medellin'>Medellin</a> in that sense. However, it was much quieter and well... not as exciting, beautiful, or warm as Medellin :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full of churches, colonial streets and housing, Cuenca was the most impressive city I went to in Ecuador. Walking the streets takes you back in time and definitely adds some much needed variety to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 'highlight' of Cuenca was a daytrip to El Cajas National Park which is only about an hour outside of Cuenca.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img'>\r\n<img alt='' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador2/cajas.jpg'/>\r\n<span></span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The high andean climate boasts some unique landscapes and plants. We made our way through the park visiting various lakes, forests, muddy obstacles and constantly going up and down hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ended up hitchhiking back in the back of a truck where I ended up leaving my gray nike small backpack which I've had for years. Fortunately I didn't have anything except shorts, but that bag was very handy and special to me - you've probably seen many pictures with me using it on all my hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Final Thoughts on Ecuador</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After about a week in Cuenca I was ready to head to Peru. I could have stayed in Cuenca longer, but I had plans in Lima to travel with a friend and needed a few weeks in northern Peru before heading south to Lima.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stopped by Loja in southern Ecuador and had plans to visit a few places close to Loja, but I was not especially keen on the city and after only 1 night decided to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My final thoughts on Ecuador unforutunately are not the best. It is a beautiful country with some very impressive landscapes. In fact, other than Costa Rica and Switzerland, it might be the third most beautiful country I\u2019ve been to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting its beauty aside, for the most part I was not too fond of the culture or people I encountered. Maybe the coast is different, but in the mountains it was quite quiet, tame and a little boring. Many people (mostly in the north) seemed to treat me differently, more like a extranjero than a person. Aka, they just wanted my money and didn't care about giving a good experience or impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ecuador's tourism level is high, especially in the few places I went to. Many people had an attitude similar to the <a href='/post/19/island-paradise-of-san-andres'>costal Colombians</a> where it was almost like when you go to a restaurant they didn't <b>want</b> to serve you and it was just an obligation to them. However, it was not as bad as coastal Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, I do take the majority of the blame for these negative thoughts. I came into Ecuador and was not mentally or emotionally ready to leave my beloved Colombia. I am almost 100% confident that if I return to Ecuador I would have a better opinion of it.</p>\r\n", "category": 6, "views": 321, "headline": "Cotopaxi, Ba\u00f1os, Cuenca, Loja", "image": "blogposts/ecuador2.jpg", "title": "Three weeks through Ecuador", "img_alt": "Ecuador", "post_date": "2014-02-08", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Ecuador"}}, {"pk": 29, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>Now that I\u2019m making my way through South America, I\u2019ve noticed some recurring ideas that other travelers have about Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m not going to lie, being in Colombia for so long has built a biased view of what I think travelers think of Colombia. The travelers who venture their way into Colombia already have a certain idea of the country and know enough about the current situation and feel comfortable enough to enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just about all travelers I met in Colombia had a positive experience and a positive opinion about Colombia. I even met a slew of foreigners who decided to make Colombia their home, especially in Medellin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, what I didn\u2019t know was what travelers outside of Colombia thought about the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Favorite country is Colombia, or all of South America!</h3>\r\n<p>In Colombia, in 5 months I met countless people who had traveled through all of South America and their favorite country was Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I once learned about the pride that Colombians felt when they learned I had a favorable opinion about their country. Now a days, I feel the same pride when I talk to foreigners that have the same favorable opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally as surprising as the amount of travelers that preferred Colombia was the lack of loyalty travelers had to other countries. Almost half the people that traveled all of South America said they liked Colombia more than the rest, and the other half said each country had their own thing they liked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I\u2019m outside of Colombia, things have changed because I meet many travelers that have not been to Colombia. In fact, many travelers don\u2019t even have plans of going.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Should I go to Colombia?</h3>\r\n<p>After I got into Ecuador a couple things caught me off guard - the amount of people who didn\u2019t have plans to go to Colombia, and the sheer amount of tourists in Ecuador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought Colombia was doing well in tourism, but now I see there is still much more progress to be had. Ecuador has towns full of tourists. If you go to places like Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa or Monta\u00f1ita, you will be inundated by tourists. There isn\u2019t too much culture to be experienced in these places unless you make an intention to find it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some places in Colombia such as the old town in Cartagena, Poblado in Medellin, and La Candelaria in Bogota which some might argue are comparable, but I disagree. The closest is the walled city of Cartagena, as Poblado and Candalaria are both filled with locals as well as tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found out that Colombia still was the hidden gem of South America, and I also learned that many people still are hesitant about going to the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making plans to traverse South America, it\u2019s astonishing the amount of people who stop at Ecuador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally people aren\u2019t familiar with what\u2019s in Colombia and it gets overshadowed by the rich tourism history of Ecuador and Peru. Many people just simply overlook Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is Colombia dangerous?</h3>\r\n<p>Above other opinions, people still tend to ask if Colombia is dangerous. Admittedly, there is quite a bit to see in South America and the easy choice is to take the more known route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without much research, people can venture from Argentina to Ecuador based on their reputation alone. We all know what happens to reputation when you get to Colombia - it dive bombs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact is that I have so much time invested into researching and reading about Colombia. I know the ins and outs. I know the few dangerous spots, and I know what to avoid. Sometimes I forget how much I know about the country, it is a part of me now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does take a bit of research and for that reason many people don\u2019t make the journey across the border into Colombia. It\u2019s easier to stick to the known.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The future of tourism in Colombia</h3>\r\n<p>From my limited experience in South America outside of Colombia, I can\u2019t help but think about the future of tourism in Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost everyone that goes to Colombia loves it there, but still a surprising number of people don\u2019t make their way into the country. As the years go by, tourism in Colombia is going to keep growing. Even in the two and a half years I have been learning about Colombia, I have seen tourism grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well folks, I have some insider news. It\u2019s going to keep growing. I\u2019m already thinking about how to help tourism grow, and realize opportunities that will arise from the growth in tourism.</p>\r\n", "category": 4, "views": 440, "headline": "I've noticed some recurring ideas about Colombia from fellow travelers", "image": "blogposts/banderacolombiana.jpg", "title": "3 Common Thoughts On Colombia", "img_alt": "Colombian Flag", "post_date": "2014-01-20", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Colombian Flag"}}, {"pk": 28, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>As each day passes, my idea of long-term travel becomes clearer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone who chooses a life of long-term travel does it in different ways.

Rarely people ask me questions that I have yet to hear, and I always get excited having to think about an answer that I haven't given 20 times before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is long-term travel?</h3>\r\n<p>For me, long-term travel means a slew of things. It is about choosing a challenging lifestyle that is not the norm. It is about broadening vision on life through discovering new places and cultures that would not have been possible with a normal life. It is about letting yourself go and being free in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The normal lifestyle is what we grew up thinking was the template for our life. You go to school, you get a job, you start buying stuff, you make a family, and then you teach your children the same way of life. This, my friends, is the easy route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long-term travel requires taking more risk, and a bit more imagination and ingenuity. Taking a few years off sets back your career, and sets back what many would consider success. People will advance their <b>careers</b> while you're off gaining new perspectives on <b>life</b>. Almost all people who are interested in this lifestyle stop here - it really is quite frightening taking the next step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But why do people always suggest traveling when you're young and taking a few years off of your career? The answer is because they did not take the risk when they were younger, but now wish that they did. They passed a certain point in their life (usually involving a spouse and kids) where they can no longer travel freely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Gaining life perspective from culture</h3>\r\n<p>A life based around travel introduces you to many different types of people from around the world, and can introduce you to new cultures and ways of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always been a person who thinks in the big picture. I don't just want to create a travel blog, I want to create a way to improve the world of travel blogs. I don't want to just donate to a good cause, I want to create a good cause and have others donate. I don't want to just create websites for people, I want to create a new way of developing websites. If I have interest in something, I rarely take the easy route. It\u2019s just too mundane!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, on a personal note, I don't want to just have a normal life, I want to have an <b>interesting</b> life outside the box. Because of that, after I conquered the easy route, I needed a challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up in the United States, we're taught a certain template in life that we're supposed to follow if we want to be successful (aka happy). However, other cultures do not think the same way, and the more people I meet while traveling the more options I learn about for what I want to do with my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are simple choices and there are complex choices. There are easy choices and there are difficult choices. There are interesting choices and there are boring choices. Everything is a mix of these aspects, and long-term travel is definitely not down the easy, simple, or boring path.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Freedom in life</h3>\r\n<p>Long-term travel opens the flood gates to discover what life is really about. Many times I go places without a plan. My schedule changes on a daily basis and as each day passes I have the opportunity to change anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just yesterday I met some Colombians while climbing Cotopaxi and would like to spend some time with them, so now I might be modifying my travel route, because I can. I have no set agenda, only an idea. I can go wherever, whenever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the freedom is more than just in travel. I can work on projects, relax, stress, pick my nose, climb mountains, swim in lakes, anything. I can stop and find a job, I can continue traveling, I can stay with a family, I can couchsurf, I can stay in hostels. Each day is different, and much of my direction is determined by the people I meet each and every day. I have almost total freedom to do whatever floats my boat on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"related-post text-center\">\r\n<img class=\"related-img\" src=\"/static/img/blogposts/travelwhileworking.jpg\">\r\n<span class=\"related-caption\"><h4>Related Post <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></span><a href=\"../post/22/life-as-a-working-traveler\" target=\"_blank\"> Life as a Working Traveler</a></h4></span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now there is one main restriction, and that is money.

Especially if you\u2019re coming from Bogota or anywhere in Boyaca, you will be pleasantly surprised by the warmth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately I was only in Bucaramanga for a few busy days, so I wasn\u2019t able to explore too much, however the city left a memorable experience for me and I would love to go back some day to get to know the city a little bit more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around Bucaramanga there are a few must sees such as Chichamocha Canyon and San Gil. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t been to San Gil yet, but I have heard many great things from other travelers and next time I go back to Bucaramanga I will not miss it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class='text-center'><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></span><a href='/post/15/journey-to-bucaramanga-part2' target='_blank'> Wedding in Bucaramanga</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class='text-center list-picture-header'>#4 Bogota</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img list-picture'>\r\n<img alt='bogota colombia' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/top5cities/bogota_edited.jpg'/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>People tend to either love or hate Bogota. Most of the time, to be honest, people hate it. Bogota will always have a special place in my heart because it was the first place I went to in Colombia and where I spent most of my time the first 2 trips to Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bogota is a lot bigger than people realize. With around 8 million people, only S\u00e3o Paolo of Brazil has more people in South America. There really is a lot to explore in Bogot\u00e1, but unfortunately many people only hit the touristy spots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not the cleanest city. You will find many dirty areas, shady areas, and it\u2019s possible to find yourself in some dangerous areas as well. However, everything you would want to see in Bogot\u00e1 is generally located in safe areas, the dangerous areas have back backed away into areas where there really is nothing to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, Bogot\u00e1 is the most <b>real</b> city. You will find many different cultures in Bogot\u00e1, many of which are not replicated anywhere else in Colombia. There is so much to see in the vast city, and if you like to explore the unknown and experience real culture, you will enjoy Bogot\u00e1 as much as I do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class='text-center list-picture-header'>#3 Cartagena</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img list-picture'>\r\n<img alt='cartagena colombia' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/top5cities/cartagena_edited.jpg'/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cartagena sees more tourism than any other Colombian city, and for good reason. The old walled city of Cartagena is interesting, exciting, beautiful, and unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where else can you go to find an old historical, colorful, walled city with plenty of attractions to keep people busy for a few days? Let me know if you know another one, I\u2019d like to go there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is plenty to see and do within the walled city city, most of which involves walking around all the eloquent shops, seeing the beautiful colonial buildings, and visiting museums to learn about the fascinating walled city of Cartagena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, you\u2019re also smack dab in the middle of the caribbean coast weather which makes for the perfect place for a winter excursion. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class='text-center list-picture-header'>#2 Pereira</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img list-picture'>\r\n<img alt='pereira colombia' src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/top5cities/pereira_edited.jpg'/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Centrally located in the coffee region, there is much to see in Pereira and its surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside of the city there are a few attractions such as la Circunvalar, central plaza, Jardin Botanico, and various viewpoints of the city. Many people refer to Pereira as a \u201clittle Medellin\u201d because it offers friendly paisas as well as a favorable climate, but is a smaller city with less hustle and bustle. It certainly provided some much needed warmth after spending some time in the nearby mountain towns of Manizales and Salento.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"related-post text-center\">\r\n<img class=\"related-img\" src=\"/static/img/blogposts/viewpoint.jpg\">\r\n<span class=\"related-caption\"><h4>Related Post <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></span><a href=\"../post/25/my-top-5-colombia-nature-spots/\" target=\"_blank\"> Top 5 Nature Spots in Colombia</a></h4></span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside of the city is just the start. As mentioned a couple of paragraphs ago, it is located in the center of the coffee region and is also the largest city of the region. There is so much to explore around the city such as Salento, Valle de Cocora, Santa Rosa de Cabal, various pueblos, Coffee Park in Montenegro, Armenia, and so much more.

I don\u2019t even know where to start with Medellin, and I get goosebumps just thinking about the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather is absolutely perfect in my opinion, and according to many other people. There\u2019s really not much else to say, you just have to go to understand. Having perfect weather each and every day really makes life easy to enjoy, even if it\u2019s not going that well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medellin is the most lively city I have ever been to. There are countless events which happen almost every single day, and best of all, most of them are free.

I started the day off in Cali Colombia and because it was peak season, finding a ticket south was quite the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scouring almost all the companies in the Cali bus terminal, after an hour of searching almost all companies said they were sold out until January 5th. It was seeming like I would be stuck in Cali an extra day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, I found an ecuadorian couple who were trying to head south as well, and we quickly joined forces and started searching together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A miracle happened and we found some tickets to Pasto Colombia which is only about 2 hours from the Ecuadorian border. Perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a 10 hour, cramped bus ride, we arrived to Pasto just a little bit short of midnight. Now what? I had no plans and had no idea where I'd end up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with my Ecuadorian friends, we found some other people in the Pasto bus terminal who were intending to go to Ecuador and after about an hour we formed a hodge-podge group of 12 people, which is what a van driver told us was needed to go to the Ecuadorian border. There were no more buses heading towards Ecuador for the night, so that was our only hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another couple hours passed and we approached the border of Ecuador. Finally! We powered through the border, which had no line at 2am, and the Ecuadorians ended up staying the night in the Ecuadorian border town as I continued on a bus to Quito.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador/landscape.jpg' alt='Ecuador landscape between Otavalo and Quito'>\r\n<span>Bus ride from Quito to Otavalo</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>First day in Ecuador</h3>\r\n<p>The ride from the border town of Tulcan to Quito is about 5 hours, so that put me into the Carcelen Quito Bus Terminal around 8 in the morning. I didn't even know I would end up in Quito, let alone where I would stay. So... it was time to find wifi and do some reasearch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I searched and asked and searched and asked, but there was no wifi in the bus terminal nor wifi within a few block radius. So, I had to abandon my plans to do my own research and rely on the advice of a couple taxi drivers which told me a neighborhood which had plenty of hostels to choose from called Mariscal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a rather expensive taxi ride, I arrived to a super touristy, expensive neighborhood which is exactly <b>not</b> what I search for. However, I was glad to finally arrive to a place where I could rest and relax after the 18 hour impromptu excursion from Cali to Quito.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another curveball was thrown my direction. After asking 5 or 6 hostels, no one had availability. Damn tourism high-season!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found a rather dodgy looking hostel (everything is a bit dodgy in Quito) who had availability and I quickly secured that up for a night. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had full intention of leaving Quito the next day. I was not feeling it, and I had not heard good things from friends either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, I think I was a bit judgemental about Quito. Coupled with my sadness of leaving Colombia, my preconceived conception of Quito didn't give the city any chance. One day I think I'll return with a fresh mindset and see if it is any different. A less-touristy area would help as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the day was relaxed and I just chatted with people in the hostel to recover from the long journey. I met a german friend who had been living in Ecuador for a few months doing volunteer work and had the same love for Ecuador as I had for Colombia. She was heading to Otavalo (a town north of Quito famous for their indiginous handicraft market) to meet some friends and I decided to join her and check it out as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Otavalo</h3>\r\n<p>After a 30 minute taxi ride and a 2 hour bus ride we arrived to the town of Otavalo. Indigenous mecca! I'd never seen so many indigenous in my life and it was a unique experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We walked around the town and I found out the friends of my german friend had been traveling around for years, and that I was traveling with a clown and a mime! I also found out they ran out of money and needed to work that day, and was lucky enough to watch the mime's performance which was very amusing. He had been doing this for over 20 years, and I could tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador/mime.jpg' alt='Mime performace in Otavalo Ecuador market'>\r\n<span>Performace in the Otavalo market</span>\r\n</div\r\n\r\n<p>The market was full of all sorts of handicrafts with the vast majority made by indigenous people who lived in and around Otavalo. Everything from hats to blankets to hammocks to trinkets to countless other things could be found. I wasn't looking to spend any money, however the two german girls I was with ended up buying about 15 items, including a new bag they needed to carry all their stuff! :)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador/artesanias.jpg' alt='Artesania market in Otavalo Ecuador'>\r\n<span>Handicraft market in Otavalo Ecuador</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After a couple hours of strolling through the market we went to a market to purchase items for dinner. We found some vegetables, fruits, bread and wine. There would be 11 of their friends staying at our $2/night hostel and we were going to make some sort of fruit/vegetable concoction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We made our way to the hostel outside of town which was a colorful place with a fantastic view. It was far from a normal hostel which I was accustomed to, but overall it was a good experience. There was no hot water, no wifi, and it was more or less a shack with an outdoor kitchen for us to cook. I'm used to cheap hostels, but this was pushing the limit. What it lacked in accommodation, it was rich in character. At $2/night, it would suffice for a couple days.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='/static/img/blogposts/embed/ecuador/hostel.jpg' alt='Hostel Otavalo Ecuador'>\r\n<span>Cheap hostel just outside of Otavalo</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We chatted throughout the evening with an eclectic group of, for lack of a better term, hippies mainly from Germany and France. Some people were busy cooking dinner while other people were busy making little handicrafts, similar to those that we saw in the market!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, after a cancelled hike to Laguna Cuicocha, I headed back to Quito to spend a night before heading off to Cotopaxi, the most famous mountain in Ecuador.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thoughts on Ecuador</h3>\r\n<p>I'm not sure how clouded my mind is from my Colombia withdrawals, or if I've been affected by other people's opinions of Ecuador, but my first few days in Ecuador have been rough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I keep comparing everything to Colombia, and nothing seems to match up well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buildings and structures gray and dreary. The colorful architecture of Colombia (with some exceptions, especially Bogota) had been replaced by more depressing buildings. Maybe it would be just the parts I've been to the first couple days, who knows?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The uplifting Colombian rhythms of salsa, merengue and vallenato have disappeared. The music here has a different feel to it, and it doesn't give me the same happiness as the Colombian music I have been accustomed to. On the plus side, I have been hearing more bachata, which is something I wish was more popular in Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people are different. They just simply aren't as friendly. People don't look at me and smile. When I ask for directions, they don't seem interested in helping. When I greet people, they don't share the same excitement as seen in Colombians. There are many other reasons, and it's just so hard to put into words. Above everything else, I have really missed the Colombian people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've only been to a few places in Ecuador, and admittedly I think the best places (Cotopaxi, Ba\u00f1os, Cuenca) are yet to come. I have a lot of hope that my opinion and experience of Ecuador will change in the next few weeks. I really feel I'm just a bitter about leaving my beloved Colombia. We'll see how it goes!</p>\r\n", "category": 6, "views": 404, "headline": "Starting off, getting to Ecuador from Colombia was quite the adventure", "image": "blogposts/quito.jpg", "title": "First Impressions of Ecuador", "img_alt": "View of Quito Ecuador ", "post_date": "2014-01-08", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "View of Quito Ecuador "}}, {"pk": 25, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<h3 class='text-center'>#5 Quimbaya Otun</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-img list-picture'>\r\n<img title='View over Quimbaya Otun near Laguna Otun' alt='View over Quimbaya Otun near Laguna Otun' src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/top5nature/ceilan_edited.jpg'/>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting off the list is the wilderness of Quimbaya Otun.

Getting to the lake is not the easiest journey, hence the reason it is off the beaten path.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from Pereira, you need to take a chiva (special Colombian bus) that goes past the pueblo La Florida, and then through a dirt road which ends at a place called El Cedral. The chiva ride alone from Pereira takes a little more than an hour, but it is the only public transportation that will get you that far into the mountains. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chiva only runs a few times a day, and unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to catch it. Normal buses only go to La Florida so I ended up having to walk from La Florida to el Cedral, tacking on an extra 12km to my hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From La Florida the walk to El Cedral took about two and a half hours through some beautiful country and then through some densely covered forest roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/walkfromflorida.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Walk through rolling hills from La Florida'>\r\n<span>Walk through rolling hills from La Florida</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/path.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Trail to El Cedral'>\r\n<span>Walking on a long road from La Florida to El Cedral</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually the road ended and I arrived to a couple structures, which the two French tourists I met told me that the place was indeed El Cedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The walk up to this point was rainy, but through the dirt road it wasn\u2019t a tough walk. That would dramatically change after El Cedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rain intensified, and the narrow path turned into a small makeshift river. Jumping from rock to rock trying not to soak my shoes worked out well for a while, but in this 5km stretch it didn\u2019t take long before slipping into the mud and streaming water ridded my desire to keep my feet dry and clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/sign.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Walking to La Pastora towards Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>The sign wants me to go where??</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/riverpath.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Walking to La Pastora towards Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>Is this a path or a stream?</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past I would have been stressed out about the rain and having everything wet, however in these days I appreciate the more 'difficult' memories almost more than the positive ones. They\u2019re more memorable and meaningful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually I escaped the thick forest and came into a clearing in which sat a cottage named Ceilan where I bought a coffee and cheese. This was the first time where the view opened up and I was able to see the beauty of the backcountry mountains in the Quimbaya Ot\u00fan regional park.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/ceilan.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='El Ceilan in a mountain meadow'>\r\n<span>Finca El Ceilan</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing my snack at the cottage, I made the last 30 minutes of the river-rock-hopping 'hike' and found La Pastora - the cottage that I would be staying at. Luckily I arrived right on time - 15 minutes of daylight left.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/lapastora.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='La Pastora near Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>View from La Pastora</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>La Pastora is a well-built, beautiful mountain cottage that can host people as well as provide food. There is no other place that can host people this deep into the Quimbaya Ot\u00fan wilderness, so it\u2019s essential to stay there if you\u2019re wanting to make it to the Laguna Ot\u00fan which is sits at over 12,000 feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no electricity in the cottage, and only a few candles to provide light, there wasn\u2019t much to do after dark. After eating a typical home-cooked Colombian dinner, I went to bed early in preparation to waking up early for long hike the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>The trek from La Pastora to Laguna Ot\u00fan is 13km (8 miles) and goes from an elevation of 2000m to 3900m (6500ft to 12800ft). It is not an easy hike, and for an experienced, fast hiker such as myself it requires pretty much the entire day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hike is the definition of 'off the beaten path'. I only saw two people the entire day hiking on the trail and was hiking alone through the Colombian mountains. The sense of freedom was overwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily there wasn\u2019t too much rain on this day and the path was much drier than the previous day. However, the rocky terrain continued for 8km from La Pastora to a place called El Bosque. That meant that I was still needing to rock hop, which made the hike more difficult but quite exciting and rewarding!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were patches of forest, meadows, and many farm animals such as horses, cows, pigs, and sheep. I passed some incredible places while making the climb.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/sheep.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Sheep near Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>Sheep on a finca near La Secreta</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, I got lost. The best trails are the ones that you make with your own two feet. Getting lost while hiking is one of the most exhilarating things for me, and having to find your way back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ended up at a place called La Secreta and then realized that something was not correct when the path ended at a gate to private property. Luckily there were people at that finca and they were super friendly (like 95% of Colombians) and showed me the way to El Bosque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bad news (or good news) was that they pointed straight up a large mountain and said I needed to go there! The even worse news (or even better?) was that I needed to cross a river to get to where they pointed me to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually I found a few trees that formed a small bridge and was able to successfully cross the river. Then for about 20 minutes I was scaling the side of a grassy mountain making my way up to what I hoped was El Bosque. Unfortunately after I reached the top I was still lost and there was no sign of any place called El Bosque. But it\u2019s hard to be upset with such amazing views.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/viewpoint.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Looking over the Quimbaya Otun regional park'>\r\n<span>View near the top of the mountain</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I made my way under a few barbed wire fences through some ranches and eventually saw a house. I made my way over towards the house and intended to ask for directions, but the house turned out to be on the main path, and I continued along until I reached a sign that said El Bosque. The funny thing is that bosque means forest, and it was actually in a meadow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing along the path I found someone else on the trail. He was a Colombian campesino (farmer) standing next to his horse waiting next to a sign pointing in the direction of la Laguna Ot\u00fan. He told me there was only about an hour left to the lake, but I was skeptical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After getting lost, I was about an hour behind schedule and was thinking about not going all the way to the lake. However, when the campesino told me there was only an hour left, my motivation to reach the lake increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I was getting exhausted. The climb up was challenging, and having to scale the side of the grassy mountain did not help. I needed to stop a few times to take a rest and eat some trail mix and drink water - something I very rarely do while hiking solo. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually I made it high enough to where the entire ambiance changed and it was clear I was in a high andean climate. Things became drier, and the greens turned into browns. The types of plants and trees changed to something that seemed from a different planet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/trees.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Trees near Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>Strange looking trees</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After about an hour of hiking after talking to the campesino, I knew I was close. However, the clouds began to roll in, and everything became difficult to see. The paths started to multiply and there were no signs pointing me in the direction of the lake. I tried a few different paths but none of them seemed to be correct.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/fog.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Fog near Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>Fog slowly taking over my vision</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/highpath.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Path near Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>Is this the right way??</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There were some very strange looking plants called freilejons, and they indicated that the lake was very close. I knew I close, but could not find the damn lake!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/freilejon.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='freilejones near Laguna Otun'>\r\n<span>Freilejones</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After trying a few paths, I had a decision to make. I was tired, out of water, and it was later than I wanted it to be. There was absolutely no way I could be hiking in the dark so I couldn\u2019t waste too much more time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fog became very thick while I was wandering trying to find the lake. If I found the lake, the pictures would be terrible anyway. I decided it was best to head back to La Pastora. I ended up not finding the lake, but overall the hike was completely successful.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The journey back was fairly uneventful with the highlight being able to backtrack on the correct path and seeing where I took the wrong path.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='content-image'>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/otun/crossingpaths.jpg' alt='Colombia Laguna Otun Quimbaya' title='Path in Quimbaya Otun'>\r\n<span>Where I took the wrong turn</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I went right, and I should have gone left. This picture doesn\u2019t tell the whole story - before this was a dirt path and the dirt path clearly continued on the right, but I needed to take the right path on the left. Also, cows were staring at me on the right so it was mostly their fault.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next time find yourself near Pereira and have interest in the Quimbaya Ot\u00fan area, let me know if you have any questions!</p>", "category": 4, "views": 655, "headline": "If you are looking for something off the beaten path, have I got a treat for you", "image": "blogposts/viewpoint.jpg", "title": "Hike to Laguna Otun", "img_alt": "View over Quimbaya Otun near Laguna Otun", "post_date": "2013-12-23", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "View over Quimbaya Otun near Laguna Otun"}}, {"pk": 22, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>My life has definitely been changing in the last couple weeks since <a href=\\\u201dhttp://travelblogsource.com/\\\u201d>Travel Blog Source</a> (TBS from here on out) has gone live. I\u2019ve been living in <a href=\\\u201dhttp://kolibrihostel.com/\\\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Kolibri Hostel</a> in Pereira (which I <b>highly</b> recommend) for the last couple weeks and I\u2019ve turned from a traveler to someone juggling many projects while traveling on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Slew of projects</h3>\r\n<p>To be honest, I\u2019m loving it. Today I had the first travel blogs register on TBS and I have been completely giddy all day after I saw the two new blog sites for approval in my notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than TBS, I\u2019ve also been developing another site to showcase my works and also act as a home for clients to interact with. I\u2019ve already met two potential clients while traveling, and there are some other prospects in the new future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, I still have this travel blog which you all know and love (I hope!). I\u2019m doing what I do best - staying busy and accomplishing a lot more than one should be able to accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Living a different life from my traveling peers</h3>\r\n<p>However, lately I\u2019ve been having some unique feelings. Unique, but very positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After living in Hostal Kolibri for an extended amount of time, it feels \u201cstrange\u201d being so different from other travelers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s strange sitting in the hostel working in the day while the other people look at me curiously while I slave away on my computer all day after declining invites to go to sites that I have already been to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New travelers arrive every day, we build a short-lived friendship, and then they leave after two or three days. The same questions get asked over and over again - Where are you from? How long have you been traveling? How long have you been in Colombia? What have you liked the most? With some people a stronger friendship is formed, and with some it\u2019s just a temporary friendship that will fade as soon as they head to their next destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though it\u2019s not as much of a shock to other travelers as to people back home when I say \u201cI\u2019m traveling for 1-5 years, I think\u201d, it still is something different for travelers. When people find out about my projects that I work on they become intrigued. The majority of my clients will be people I meet on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think about it, it\u2019s almost perfect. I get to tell people about my TBS site, whose clients are mainly travelers and people with travel blogs. I will be meeting many of those people during my travels. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also have a chance to talk to many people about custom development, which some people on the road have a need for (I\u2019ve already met 2 in just a month). In a fixed location, I would never be able to talk to so many diverse people, nor find as many clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><b>If you liked this post, please consider sharing!</b>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stepsoftravel\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\">Follow @stepsoftravel</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"stepsoftravel\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a>'\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It feels great to be travelling while also having projects and income streams in the near future. It makes it even better that some of the income streams are in something I greatly enjoy - web development. I believe I have now made the transition from a traveler to a working traveler. Now I just need to start making money! It will come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why work while traveling?</h3>\r\n<p>Some people wonder why I would want to work when I am in these beautiful foreign lands traveling. Well, the truth is that I could be working in a fixed location, or I could be working all over the world for an undetermined length of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seems like a simple decision to me? It\u2019s a different lifestyle - definitely life out of the box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some days I take a break and do the touristy things. Some days I go out with friends from all over the world I meet while traveling. Some days I take a day trip to a nearby pueblo. Some days I just have a normal day working. It\u2019s amazing, and I\u2019m loving it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <i>flexibility</i> and <i>spontaneity</i> of this life is something unmatched. Running two websites while also working on other people\u2019s projects while on the road presents many obstacles and challenges, but it provides something to learn and improve each and every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"related-post text-center row-fluid offset2\">\r\n  <div class=\"span3\">\r\n    <img class=\"related-img\" src=\"/static/img/blogposts/vision.JPG\">\r\n    <span class=\"related-caption\"><h4>Related Post: <a href=\"../post/11/the-game-of-life/\" t    target=\"_blank\">The Game of Life</a></h4></span>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"span3 offset2\">\r\n    <img class=\"related-img\" src=\"/static/img/blogposts/longtermtravel.png\"> \r\n    <span class=\"related-caption\"><h4>Related Post: <a href=\"../post/28/what-is-long-term-travel\"   target=\"_blank\">What is Long Term Travel?</a></h4></span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed previously, I was thinking about <a href=\\\u201dhttp://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/20/after-3-months-in-colombia\\\u201d>settling down in Colombia</a>.

Adams</a>, or other hikes in the ol\u2019 USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually we got to the top of the trail and arrived at The Mountain, where we found out that we weren\u2019t actually climbing a mountain, but it was a place that had a great view of a mountain across the valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/salento/mountain.jpg' title='View looking across Valle de Cocora at The Mountain' />\r\n<span>View of the The Mountain across the Valle de Cocora</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We took an extended break at The Mountain and sat down on the benches while eating a few snacks and conversing about various topics that a group of travelers usually talk about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we arrived at the top, there were not many clouds, however the clouds began flooding in up the valley at an incredible pace. Watching the clouds rush in through the narrow valley door and rise up to our level was something interesting to see, however at the same time it was concerning because some of the best views were still to come. Had we waited too long at The Mountain?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started the descent down, which was much easier than the climb up, obviously. For a while, it wasn\u2019t too impressive. We weren\u2019t walking on a trail, but a road. At one point, we came up to a gate which was locked, which made us question whether or not we missed a path we were supposed to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, soon after the gate we found out we were headed in the right direction with the best view yet of the valley. We took another long break and took in the memorable view while discussing in depth the World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/salento/valley.jpg' title='Valle de Cocora Salento Colombia' />\r\n<span>View overlooking Valle de Cocora</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After a while, even though we would have loved to stay there all day, we decided to continue so that we could go to a coffee tour after getting back into town. Continuing our descent down the dirt road, we eventually made it to a clearing. Wow. Stunning.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/salento/waxpalms.jpg' title='Wax Palms in Valle de Cocora' />\r\n<span>Stunning views through the Valle de Cocora</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We definitely saved the best for last, making our way through the curvy dirt road through the Valle de Cocora with countless of the famous Wax Palms towering above us on all sides. I took so many pictures and had to tell myself, \u201cOk. Stop. These are all the same!\u201d But the views continued to be amazing all the way back down while we walked along the dirt road and grass fields to arrive back at the trailhead to catch a jeep back to Salento. For more pictures check out my <a href='https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5954498495533366337' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Coffee Triangle Album</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After getting back to Salento, we had plans to go to a coffee tour outside of town, but a downpour of rain quickly crushed those plans. We had some luck because the jeep driver was nice enough to drive us to a restaurant to eat lunch instead of leaving us at the central plaza where we would normally get out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the day was mostly spent inside due to the weather, and the next day I would head to the coffee tour at the Finca de Don Elias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After waking up and eating a delicious Colombian breakfast in the hostel, I made my way through town asking locals how to get to the finca of Don Elias. Luckily, one person knew what I was talking about and was able to point me in the right direction. I had to ask about 6 other people before someone was able to confirm I was in fact walking the right way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is something special about walking through the colombian countryside solo. There is a sense of freedom and solidarity which frees the mind. It\u2019s a similar feeling to backpacking through mountains. Peace and serenity squelch all problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/salento/walktofinca.jpg' title='Walking to Don Elias finca outside Salento Colombia' />\r\n<span>Stunning views all the way to the finca</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After about 3 kilometers, finally I arrived to the coffee finca. A few little girls (about 3-4 years old) met me at the gate and told me to come with them to their grandparents house. They led me down the path through some banana trees and soon enough we got to the finca where I met their cousin, and he would be my tour guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was a 20 year old Colombian and was super friendly. When he was not telling me about the coffee farm, we talked about <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/4/why-colombia' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>my love for Colombia</a>. What an interesting life they have there on the finca - it made me wonder if some day I would have a Colombian finca in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/salento/fincatour.jpg' title='Tour through Don Elias Finca outside of Salento Colombia' />\r\n<span>He was way more friendly than he looks in this picture!</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After the tour, I bought a bag of their fresh coffee for a regalito and made my way back towards Salento where I would meet up with my Costa Rican friend to head to the nearby city of Pereira.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I highly recommend going to Salento if you visit Colombia, it is very high on my list of things to see in Colombia. I\u2019ll be making that list in a few weeks when I finally leave my beloved Colombia and make my way into Ecuador.</p>\r\n", "category": 4, "views": 330, "headline": "Don't pass up the tranquil, peaceful experience of Salento Colombia", "image": "blogposts/valleyview.jpg", "title": "Salento and Valle de Cocora", "img_alt": "Colombia Valle de Cocora mountains nature", "post_date": "2013-12-10", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Looking over the Valle de Cocora near Salento"}}, {"pk": 20, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>Well, It is November 29th which means today marks my 3 month anniversary in my beloved Colombia. So many thoughts have been going through my head during my time in Manizales, and I have no idea how I\u2019m supposed to contain them all to fit in one focused post. But, I will try my best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I definitely accomplished my main goal for my time in Colombia, and that was to decide if and where I wanted to move to in the future. After living up to its high expectations, Medellin quickly stole my heart away from Bogota. For some details, I would suggest reading my <a href='/post/10/first-impressions-of-medellin' target=\"_blank\">First Impressions of Medellin</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had 2 goals for things that I did <u>not</u> want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing was that I didn\u2019t want to get involved with work. Fail... Fail. I totally failed, hard. The last 2 months I have been completely engulfing myself in my <a href='/post/18/my-project-travel-blog-source' target=\"_blank\">Travel Blog Source</a> project. The good side is that after 2 months of website development and business planning, I\u2019m days away from opening it up to people who are wanting to poke around and test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that, while writing this article a guy that I\u2019m living with approached me about building a website for him. He just bought a house here in Manizales and is going to start a Bed and Breakfast. Now I\u2019m thinking about expanding the scope of my business to do freelance web development and Travel Blog Source would essentially be one of my customers (along with this blog!). Oh the options\u2026</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, come on, let\u2019s be realistic. I\u2019m such a dedicated and motivated person and after about two weeks in Medellin I had the itch to do something special. I wasn\u2019t traveling, I wasn\u2019t studying, and I wasn\u2019t working. <b>I needed to do something!</b> To be honest, I\u2019m not too disappointed, and I kind of knew I was going to fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second thing that I wasn\u2019t supposed to do was get emotionally attached to a lady friend and lead myself to abandon my trip. I was particularly scared about failing this one, but I would say this one was a draw. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I definitely have become very emotionally attached to someone in particular, but we\u2019ve known the situation the whole time. It\u2019s been hard, but I think we\u2019ve done enough so far to squelch our feelings/relationship and I do not have plans to cancel my trip because of her. But, it has not been easy. Shoutout to my paisa, my hidden-one, my guide, my little ugly-one, and my giraffe. Obviously some things are just better off left in spanish\u2026 I leave it at that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Should I stay, or should I go?</h3>\r\nBut wait a minute, let\u2019s think about why I made these goals in the first place. Here\u2019s a hint, it all hinges around my decision to stay in <a href='/post/5/colombia-or-latin-america' target=\"_blank\">Colombia or travel Latin America</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The details are in the article, but I knew coming into this that it would be hard to leave Colombia. The reason I had these goals of things <b>not</b> to do were because these are things that would keep me in Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>But Adam, if you love <a href='/post/4/why-colombia' target=\"_blank\">Colombia</a> so much, why are you leaving?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funny you should ask me that, I\u2019ve been asking myself the same damn question!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here\u2019s my rationale - I know if I stay in Colombia right now, there\u2019s a good chance I will stay here for a while. There\u2019s also a good chance I\u2019ll meet someone, and I want to start a family in the next few years. Yes mom, you read that correctly, and no, you don\u2019t need to publicly comment on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the present time, I really want to just get an apartment, get a job, and stay in Colombia until a day comes when I decide it\u2019s time to move on. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the future always gets in my way. Will I ever get the chance to freely travel again? Maybe. It would become increasingly more difficult over time with decreased earnings and possibly picking up a travel companion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My time in Manizales has given me time to reflect, what do I really want? Being away from Medellin has made me understand what a fantastic city it is, but unfortunately, I still don\u2019t quite have the answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Problems of solo traveling</h3>\r\n<p>Back in the day when I was constantly answering questions about my trip, people would ask me, \u201cAre you going with anyone?\u201d Well, as you can imagine, the answer was always no. Unless I felt like being snide and sarcastic, then maybe I answered a bit differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solo traveling has a unique dynamic, something that many people don\u2019t have a full grasp upon. For long-term travel (which essentially means making travel your life for years), it\u2019s quite difficult to include anyone else. A significant other is usually the only exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flexibility is addicting. The freedom is inspiring. However, sometimes the uncertainty and loneliness can be wrenching. Especially for someone a bit introverted like me who does not have the easiest time meeting new people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Closing thoughts after 3 months</h3>\r\n<p>These months in Colombia have cemented my thoughts that <b>Colombia truly is a beautiful country</b>. The landscape, the people, the culture, and the general vibe captivate me. Right now, the opportunity in Colombia is limited, but the country is improving every year. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this final month, the big question will be <b>should I stay, or should I go?</b> Should I go with my brain and continue along my path, or should I go with my heart and stay in Colombia? During the next few weeks in Manizales, Salento, Armenia, and the rest of the coffee triangle I will have plenty of time and solitude to think things over.</p>\r\n", "category": 5, "views": 334, "headline": "Well, It is November 29th which means today marks my 3 month anniversary in my beloved Colombia.", "image": "blogposts/3Months.jpg", "title": "After 3 Months in Colombia", "img_alt": "Colombia Collage", "post_date": "2013-11-28", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Colombia Collage"}}, {"pk": 19, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>San Andres could very well be the most photogenic place in Colombia. You can\u2019t find comparable caribbean beaches anywhere else in Colombia except for <u>possibly</u> the islands of Baru. Providencia would be another place, but that\u2019s right next to San Andres so for the sake of argument I\u2019m grouping them together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, I had not been planning on going to San Andres. I\u2019m now a budget traveler, and it\u2019s quite out of the way for something that doesn\u2019t satisfy my <a href='/post/6/finding-your-travel-style' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>travel style</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my friends I met in Medellin from Couchsurfing found some cheap tickets and decided to head out to the island paradise. I had to take a look at the prices. To my surprise, a round-trip ticket from Medellin to San Andres was only $95 - final price from Viva Colombia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that price, I didn\u2019t have an option. It would be idiotic not to take advantage of this low-season price. <b>Note: in high season prices soar above $300</b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Getting to San Andres</h3>\r\n<p>After taking an hour-long bus ride from Medellin to the airport, a 3 hour delay, and a 2 hour flight, I finally arrived to the island of San Andres.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/fromairplane.jpg' alt=\u201dView of San Andres from the airplane\u201d title=\u201dView of San Andres from the airplane\u201d />\r\n<span>View of San Andres from the airplane</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The line to check the tourism card took about 15 minutes to clear, and then it was time to find my hostel. All I knew was the name of the hostel, so I just walked the streets asking locals how to get to \u201cEl Viajero\u201d and eventually found it on one of the main streets. Of course I could have taken a taxi, but where\u2019s the fun in that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of locals in San Andres was different than I had expected. I was expecting more tourists and less locals - but as it turned out, about 95% of the people were locals. Not only just in the non-touristy areas, but even in the touristy areas the locals flooded the streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was a good thing. I\u2019m not at all a fan of touristy places in this phase of my life and travels. When I am traveling with a girlfriend/wife and/or family, I\u2019m all for the touristy spots. But for now, I\u2019m in search of real culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Andres was a bit of a mix of real vs touristy. While traversing the island by bus, we passed through the real areas where the locals lived. That part was interesting. I would have liked to get out of the bus and walk around, but never took the opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you\u2019re not aware, there has been a dispute whether San Andres and Providencia belong to Colombia or Nicaragua. In 2012 there was a court ruling that the islands belong to Nicaragua, but Colombia somehow \u201crejected\u201d the decision and the islands are still Colombian. Anyway, what I want to say is that the neighborhoods where the locals live strongly resemble the barrios that I have been to in Nicaragua and not so much Colombia. I found that quite interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Beaches</h3>\r\n<p>First of all, I\u2019ve never been to more beautiful beaches in my life. I will consider myself lucky if I\u2019m able to find such pristine beaches and water so perfect again in my life. The beach on a small island called Johnny Cay off the coast of the main island was the best beach I encountered in San Andres. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/johnnybeach.jpg' alt=\u201dJohnny Cay San Andres\u201d title=\u201dJohnny Cay San Andres\u201d />\r\n<span>The beach of Johnny Cay off the coast of San Andres</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That beach was well groomed for tourism, but walking around the small cay (which took all of 10 minutes) led to some other great views of how the cay looks naturally.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/johnny1.jpg' alt=\u201dDock in Johnny Cay\u201d title=\u201dView of the dock in Johnny Cay\u201d />\r\n<span>View of the dock in Johnny Cay</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/johnny2.jpg' alt=\u201dInterior of Johnny Cay\u201d title=\u201dInterior of Johnny Cay\u201d />\r\n<span>Middle of Johnny Cay</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/johnny3.jpg' alt=\u201dJohnny Cay\u201d title=\u201dJohnny Cay\u201d />\r\n<span>Johnny Cay from the boat</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After spending about 4 hours out on the cay, hunger began to set in. There were plenty of things to eat and drink on the cay, but at very high touristic prices. We decided to head over to the dock and catch the boat back to the main island.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Walk to Roquiqui</h3>\r\n<p>My argentinian friend I met on the island and I decided to walk to a beach called San Luis. However, after about an hour of walking, we found out that San Luis was actually quite far. He took a bike ride a few days prior and seemed to think it was closer, but it was a good adventure nonetheless!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ended up at another beach called Roquiqui which has a shallow strip of ocean that allows you to walk through the waist-high water to another small cay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We unexpectedly ran into some of our friends from the hostel at Roquiqui and spent the rest of the day at the beach after making the walk out to the cay.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bike Excursion</h3>\r\n<p>Another highlight would have been the bike ride around the island. I decided to do the bike tour the last day, which turned out to be a mistake. <b>But, mistakes always turn into great memories!</b></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/bike.jpg' alt=\u201dBike tour of San Andres\u201d title=\u201dBike tour of San Andres\u201d />\r\n<span>Making my way around the island. I was telling the person to take the picture from another angle, but I liked this pic!</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From the first minute I was on that bike, I knew something was not right. The pedal kept \u201ccatching\u201d and when I pedaled I would lose the friction for about a second. As time went on, it became worse and worse. After about half an hour it became so bad that I stopped to ask some locals if they had a screwdriver. No luck. I kept pedaling along, struggling quite a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the pedal fell off. Literally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a good laugh, picked up the pedal, and began walking down the beautiful road and arrived to the San Luis beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After walking along the beach for a bit, I decided to hitchhike back to town to return the broken bike. About 4 trucks passed me up before I abandoned that idea, as well as the bike. I locked it up against a post and would tell the person that the bike she gave me sucks, it\u2019s safe in San Luis, and that I needed a refund. It was about $7 for 6 hours, and she decided to give me $2 back. No big deal :)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/sanandres/sanluis.jpg' alt=\u201dWalking along San Luis\u201d title=\u201dWalking along San Luis\u201d />\r\n<span>Walking along San Luis</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lasting Impressions of San Andres</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the trip was well worth it. For the price I paid, it was well worth it. The food and drinks were not quite as expensive as I was thinking either, so that was an added plus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really enjoyed the beaches and the ocean - they were close to perfect. For a place like this, it would have been nice to have someone special with me, but even as a solo traveler (I did go with my friend from Mexico and her german friend from Medellin) it was well worth it. I met many people there, and we all had a good time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing that I didn\u2019t like is that it was very commercialized. Everything costed money and it felt unauthentic. Good luck finding an island paradise that isn\u2019t like that, right? Let me know if you find it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I\u2019ve never been a fan of the coastal people of Colombia. They have a certain demeanor that is not friendly. I experienced that all along the northern coast of Colombia and San Andres was no different. I had read in another blog something like \u201cwhen you go to stores, it feels like the locals don\u2019t want to serve you\u201d. I felt exactly that way.</p>", "category": 4, "views": 375, "headline": "San Andres could very well be the most photogenic place in Colombia", "image": "blogposts/sanandres.jpg", "title": "Island Paradise of San Andres", "img_alt": "Island Paradse of San Andres Colombia", "post_date": "2013-11-22", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Island Paradse of San Andres Colombia"}}, {"pk": 18, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>Many people have been asking me, what is this \u201cproject\u201d you have been working on? And by many, I mean my mom and my sister. Well, I\u2019m now at a point where I can share the idea.\r\n\r\n<h3>Travel Blogging Industry Background</h3>\r\n<p>Before explaining what Travel Blog Source is, it\u2019s necessary to gain an understanding of the basics of the travel blogging industry.\r\n\r\n<p>Many long-term travelers are searching for location-independent income. They search for a way to sustain travel through income revenue that does not tie them to one location. Sounds great right? Well, it\u2019s not so easy.\r\n\r\n<p>One of my main goals has been to find a location-independent job. And believe me, there have been countless ideas run through my head. However, this one I actually think could work.\r\n\r\n<p>Travel blogs often develop over years. Owners of travel blogs start out with small vision, and then as their blog grows, they gain hundreds or thousands of followers. Having this amount of followers opens up many opportunities, which I outlined some options near the bottom of The <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/11/the-game-of-life/' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Game of Life</a>. <b>Travel blogs don\u2019t usually generate income, but when you have an audience, you have a loyal market.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ok, so what is Travel Blog Source?</h3>\r\n<p>I will start off by explaining from the \u201cBlog Search\u201d perspective, which is the main concept of the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel Blog Source is a place for people to search travel blogs around the world. It will allow people to search by country, continent, or language. The goal is to have an up-to-date, comprehensive list of travel blogs, along with some basic info and ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be possible to order by rating (based on user reviews) to get the highest rating blogs in a region, or you could sort on registration date to see the newest blogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now if someone wants to search travel blogs in a certain country, they turn to their trusty friend, Mr. Google. They will find 2-3 blogs which typically have been existent for at least 2 years - enough time to gain SEO power. It is almost impossible to find smaller and/or newer travel blogs. Travel Blog Source is going to change that, it is going to give the smaller blogs a chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, from the perspective of the \u201dTravel Blog Owner\u201d, which just happens to be the main customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As stated in the background of the Travel Blog Industry, blog owners want to grow traffic. The good news is that registering your site on Travel Blog Source is completely free and takes all of 5 minutes. The blog will get a backlink (which is very important with SEO) and gain exposure to new customers. There is nothing to lose for blog owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s a pretty simple concept, but is something that is currently missing from the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ok, but like, are you going to make $$?</h3>\r\n<p>Let me explain Sponsorships. There will be methods to increase traffic and exposure to certain travel blog sites. In the beginning, the majority of these sponsorships will be given out by social media competitions, which will not generate revenue but instead will focused on growing the user-base and traffic to Travel Blog Source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After about 6 months (my best semi-educated guess), sponsorships will begin to shift to a pay method where blog owners can pay a small amount to either highlight their blog site in searches, or appear at the top of regional searches. There will also be other opportunities such as writing a blog post which will appear on Travel Blog Source or submitting a cover picture which will show at the top of region pages and will have a link to your blog site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is it almost ready?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I think so. I plan to start marketing to blog owners in December or early January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warning - the rest of this section might be a bit technical/dry if you\u2019re not interested in development or business. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve split the project up into 3 major groups. Phase 1 website development, Phase 2 website development, and Business Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 1 development has been completed and that consisted of the basic design of the website and getting all the functionality in place. Right now it is possible to create a user, register a blog site, search registered blog sites by country or continent, submit feedback, rate blog sites, submit a blog post or cover image, and probably some other things that I\u2019m forgetting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m about to start Phase 2 development, which is getting all the other development stuff in place and fine-tuning the website. Things such as proper error handling, making sure everything looks perfect, testing, and implementing business process enhancements. This phase has some dependencies on the Business Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development is the whole business side of the project. Things such as the initial business plan, marketing plan, operations analysis, financial analysis, and again some things that I\u2019m forgetting. Some specific examples of this would be how am I going to promote the website when it\u2019s first starting out? What business processes do I foresee in the future and how can I improve them now? What pricing model do I want to go with the services provided by TBS? My favorite is improving the business processes, most of the other stuff I just BS my way through :)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Personal Note, from yours truly</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can\u2019t begin to express how much I\u2019ve enjoyed developing this idea. It\u2019s interesting being both the business owner and the developer, but that <u>is</u> my specialty and my strengths cater to this project. From the first day I thought of this idea I became very dedicated to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter which way this project goes, I have learned so much. Right now, most of the learning has been with the web development platform I use, but in the near future I will be learning many things about business as well. I need the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, I am able to do everything, so there are very little startup costs involved. Depending on how the first months of the project go, many different variables will come into play and I\u2019ll need to adjust. I look forward to that phase of the business!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on how this project goes will affect my long-term plans. If this does turn out to be a sustainable idea, I could be traveling for years. If I totally fail with the project, I\u2019ll probably end up settling somewhere after year 1 and getting a real job. But, only time will tell!</p>\r\n", "category": 3, "views": 399, "headline": "One of my main goals has been to find a location-independent job.

After all, I've been reading extensively about Colombia for over 2 years now.</p>\r\n<p>During the first couple weekends in Medell\u00edn, I asked my good friend Xiomi if there were any places she would like to visit that she hasn't gone to before. She replied without hesitation - Rio Claro.</p>\r\n<p>While <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/6/finding-your-travel-style' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>finding my travel style</a>, I found that I enjoy spending time with locals rather than other travelers. One thing that I do find even better is exploring new places with a local. Their excitement of venturing to a new place directly transpires to my mood which enhances the experience for all.</p>\r\n<p>We found a 3-day weekend when we were both available, and picked those dates to head to Rio Claro, which is about 3 hours outside of Medellin by bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>The drive to Rio Claro was stunning. Through the rolling antioque\u00f1an hills, we eventually made it through the windy mountain roads to the entrance of Rio Claro.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/ridetorioclaro.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle Antioquia\u201d title=\u201dDriving through Antioquia to Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Nature on the way to Rio Claro</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/rioclaroentrance.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle\u201d title=\u201dRio Claro Entrance Sign\u201d />\r\n<span>The entrance to Rio Claro Nature Preserve</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We made our way past the park entrance and began to scope out a camping spot. From what we read, there was \u201cabundant space\u201d and reservations were not needed. Luckily, that was true. There was a huge field with tents scattered about - definitely obliging to their claim of abundant space.</p>\r\n<p>We found a spot nestled in a corner sitting against the river. Besides a handful of backpacking spots, I can't think of a better camping spot I've been in.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/campsite.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle River Camping\u201d title=\u201dCampsite next to Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Our campsite situated next to the river</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After setting up camp and eating our \u201cgourmet\u201d lunch consisting of nutella and jelly sandwiches, chips, almonds, and other dry foods, it was about 2 in the afternoon and time to explore the park.</p>\r\n<p>We made our way through the jungle along a dirt road until we found an interesting tree overhanging the vibrant green river. Xiomi instantly got super excited and we made our way down towards the tree.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/overhangingtree.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle Tree River\u201d title=\u201dJungle Tree hanging over river\u201d />\r\n<span>Interesting tree hanging over the river</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After climbing around the tree and taking in the view for about 30 minutes, it was time to continue along the dirt path.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/stairs.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle\u201d title=\u201dStairs in Rio Claro Colombia\u201d />\r\n<span>Stairs leading to some secret place?</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We approached a makeshift parking lot with a few motos and cars parked along the side. After the parking lot came a jungle lodge for people to stay as well as the place to sign up for the rafting, climbing/canopy, or cave adventure. After some debate, we decided to sign up for the rafting and cave adventure for the following day. Lounging by the clear water, we watched a group of rafters embark upon their journey before we continued along the path.</p>\r\n<p>At this point, it was no longer a dirt path. It was an elegantly made path through the jungle and we were awestruck. What an amazing place! Xiomi, along with many paisas, hadn't made the journey over to Rio Claro, and it didn't take long for us to question why not.</p>\r\n<p>It truly felt like a jungle adventure, with the brilliant green river, exotic plants and trees, alluring sounds, and rock formations and caves that you wouldn't think were possible.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/junglepath.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle\u201d title=\u201dPath in Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Trail Pic!</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We approached a few cliff jumps which were 8m and approximately 10m. I don't really enjoy being wet when I have to do things after or there is some uncertainty, so I didn't make the jump on this day. Xiomi, on the other hand, was all for it.</p>\r\n<p>She waited for the other people to pass so she could shed some clothes and jump off the 8m plank. I descended down the path to meet her at the shore and her demeanor had completely changed. The excitement that filled her face was priceless and her new mood instantly improved mine\u2026 as if it needed to be improved in the first place. To be honest, she seemed a little too excited so I asked her if she'd ever jumped off a cliff before. No. I then understood why she was so utterly happy :)</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/junglecliffs.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle River\u201d title=\u201dCliffs into the Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>View of the cliffs from around the bend. Can you spot them?</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We continued along the path, which by the way was not crowded at all on this day. Throughout the whole path we continued to be impressed, it wasn't just a small stretch. We were simply stunned by the raw beauty of the natural jungle. Much talk ensued about never returning to Medellin and living in a jungle tree. As you can see, unfortunately, that didn't happen. Yet.</p>\r\n<p>We arrived at a \u201cbeach\u201d which was a large rock area that formed a bend in the river. We stopped for a few pictures and to take in the view before continuing on. There was another beach, Cave of Guacharos, Door to Paradise and Boca Caiman still to see, and daylight was running out.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/firstplaya.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle river\u201d title=\u201dSitting by Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Xiomi sitting by Rio Claro</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It didn't take much time to arrive to the next beach and the cave, which were situated across the river from each other. As with the rest of the park, there was not much overcrowding which enhanced the tranquility and authenticity of the whole experience.</p>\r\n<p>We decided this was the best swimming place, and we would stop here on the way back, or in the next day to do some swimming. Onward to the end.</p>\r\n<p>We continued walking along the path focused on finding the door to paradise. We thought we had already arrived to paradise a long time ago, but oh well!</p>\r\n<p>Eventually the man-made path ended and we arrived to a dirt path made in the jungle. We traversed this terrain for probably about 30 minutes while discussion of where the door to paradise and Boca Caiman were, as well as discussing when to head back. We decided to keep exploring along this jungle path until 4:30pm and then we would head back to arrive to the campsite around nightfall. </p>\r\n<p>We kept going, but didn't find the door to paradise before it was time to start backtracking. We found a jungle vine, and I decided to do my best tarzan impression. The first jump surprised me, I was not expecting to go so quickly, or as far.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/junglevine.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle\u201d title=\u201dSwinging on a vine in Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Doing my best Tarzan impression</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We continued our trek over the dirt path and hopping from rock to rock, until we came upon a small opening in a rock.</p>\r\n<p>Wait a minute, that's the door to paradise!! We had gone through this hole on the way forward, but didn't realized it.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/doortoparadise.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle\u201d title=\u201dPuerta a Paraiso in Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Puerta a Paraiso in Rio Claro</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We made the journey back on the same path which we arrived on, and made it back to our tent. There was still a little bit of light left, and we decided to take a swim in the river nearby the campsite. The current was really strong by our camp, but there was a line that went across which we could hold onto. After playing in the water for a bit, we retired back to our campsite, ate some dinner and then more-or-less called it a night.</p>\r\n<p>I wish I could say we slept well that night, but it was quite the opposite.</p>\r\n<p>The tent I bought was purchased for 45.000, or roughly $24. It did not come with a rainfly, and did not do a very good job of keeping water out. It rained. In the tent.</p>\r\n<p>The sides of the tent were completely soaked, all of our bags, pillows, and anything (including my hair!) that was near the side of the tent were drenched. There were drops of rain that would fall on us throughout the whole night.</p>\r\n<p>However, it all leads to memories, and I've learned to appreciate the bad experiences as much as the good ones. I appreciate them almost even more than the good memories.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>We woke up on the second day after a stressful, damp night and were ready to escape the tent and get back into the jungle.</p>\r\n<p>We had the cave adventure and the rafting trip planned for the day. However, we were told if it rained at night we would need to switch our cave adventure from our 9:30 departure until a time later in the afternoon due to the strong current.</p>\r\n<p>It ended up being true and we needed to switch to a 1:30 departure and have our rafting trip in the morning. However, there wasn't much time in between our two activities, and I didn't have a flashlight since something happened to my phone battery and it was no longer functioning. We would have needed to return back to the campsite to get some money and then head back to the store to buy a flashlight. I don't like schedules in the first place, and this was getting compicated. So, we decided to cancel the cave adventure and just do some adventuring of our own in the afternoon after the rafting trip.</p>\r\n<p>The rafting trip was well worth the time and money that was required. Unfortunately there are no pictures of this trip, but hopefully you all have a pretty good idea of what the scenery would be like. Overhanging trees, jungle river with some gentle rapids, and a rock overhang with thousands of stalagmites dripping water into the river.</p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/elrio.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle River\u201d title=\u201dTypical view of Rio Claro\u201d />\r\n<span>Typical view of Rio Claro</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We took a break on a small beach area across from the rock overhang and wandered around that area for about 20 minutes before making the final stint down to the pick-up point. There were a couple waterfalls which we submerged ourselves under. Everything on the rafting trip was an amazing experience and it is definitely a must-do if you ever find yourself in beautiful Rio Claro Natural Preserve.</p>\r\n<p>We got a ride back to the park, and were dropped off near our campsite. After eating our gourmet lunch yet again, we embarked upon a relaxing afternoon of exploring, swimming, and jumping off cliffs.</p>\r\n<p>The first notable place that we arrived to was the cliffs. This time I would be able to jump in, first from the 8m drop. The scenery was awesome, and I definitely had not jumped off a more photogenic cliff. Xiomi followed me off the 8m, still a bit hesitant, and questioning how she jumped the day before. However, she made it.</p>\r\n<p>I wanted more. I went up the path a little bit and after a few minutes of uncertainty, I jumped off the 10m drop. WHAT A RUSH! This one felt so much better than the 8m, and I tried fervishly to convince Xiomi to jump off. I know she would have loved it, but, I was not successful.</p>\r\n<p>We continued along up to the next place of interest - Cave of Guacharos. This time, we crossed the river and made it into the mouth of the cave. </p>\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/caveofguacharos.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle cave river\u201d title=\u201dLooking across the river to Cave of Guacharos\u201d />\r\n<span>Looking across the river to Cave of Guacharos</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was quite the dramatic entrance. We needed to climb up a net rope while fighting the power of the waterfall that was pouring out of the cave. We got in and it was impressive. Unfortunately, after the first curve, it was pitch black, so we didn't get to see too much. But even the first room was great, and made a part of me wish that we had an extra day to do the tour of the cave. Oh well, next time!</p>\r\n<p>After spending a couple hours inside the cave, exploring around the cave, and moseying around the beach, we headed back towards our campsite.</p>\r\n<p>After the cancellation of the Cave trip, we had some extra money so we were able to eat in the near-by restaurant which is at the entrance to Rio Claro. </p>\r\n<p>We had yet another rain filled night, this time, the rain was quite stronger. The rain streamed in on our faces  as well as completely soaking our bags, but life went on!</p>\r\n<p>The next day we swam in the river in the morning for about an hour while we waiting for our belongings to kind-of dry out. We met a friendly German girl along the road who was also waiting for a bus to return to Medellin. She had been waiting for an hour and a half for a bus, and after we arrived it took all of 2 minutes. Yeah, we're good luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/RioClaro/antioquia.jpg' alt=\u201dColombia Rio Claro Jungle Antioquia\u201d title=\u201dDriving through the hills of Antioquia\u201d />\r\n<span>Driving through the hills of Antioquia</span>\r\n</div>", "category": 4, "views": 473, "headline": "Spending the long weekend in Rio Claro Nature Preserve", "image": "blogposts/caveofguacharos.jpg", "title": "Weekend in Rio Claro", "img_alt": "Rio Claro Jungle River Cave", "post_date": "2013-11-10", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Cave of Guacharos in Rio Claro Colombia"}}, {"pk": 16, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "I\u2019ve been wanting to visit Chicamocha Canyon for a while - it was on my short-list of places to visit in Colombia. Finally, with the <a href=\u201dhttp://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/15/journey-to-bucaramanga-part2\u201d>wedding</a>, I would be in Bucaramanga, which is a short drive from the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe handful of Colombians that I had talked to about the canyon really talked it up. It\u2019s stunning, it\u2019s wonderful, it\u2019s bigger than the Grand Canyon, and you need to go. That is what I was told from multiple Colombians.\r\n\r\nI was expecting some fantastic views, a few places to eat, and maybe a few small hikes. The diversity of the park ended up being the difference maker, and there were many attractions that I was not expecting.\r\n\r\nThere were of course breathtaking views, but there was also a gondola ride across the canyon, a zip-line along the canyon ridge, , interesting statues, corral of baby goats, and of course some delicious food, and small \u201czoo\u201d with many types of exotic birds, ostriches, ponies, a condor, some feisty geese protecting their eggs, and probably a few other animals that I\u2019m forgetting about. \r\n\r\nOther than the specific attractions, the whole place in general was really well-kept, and everything was beautiful.\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/walkway.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha\u201d title=\u201dWalking up the path in Chichamocha\u201d />\r\n<span>Walking up the path in Chichamocha</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/plants.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha plants\u201d title=\u201dBeautiful plants all around park\u201d />\r\n<span>Beautiful plants all around park</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nI would have to say my favorite attraction was the gondola ride. While traversing the canyon, the views from the gondola were simply amazing. The ride itself took some time, I would say at least 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe views of the canyon, rock formations, abandoned fincas, and diverse landscape were something to remember.\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/gondola.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha canyon gondola\u201d title=\u201dAscending up the other side of the canyon\u201d />\r\n<span>Ascending up the other side of the canyon</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/rocks.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha canyon rocks\u201d title=\u201dRock formation nearing the top of the canyon\u201d />\r\n<span>Rock formation nearing the top of the canyon</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nUpon arrival to the other side of the canyon, I was surprised to see it developed on that side as well. There were little shops, places to eat, and arguably the best view in all of the park.\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/lavista.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha canyon nature\u201d title=\u201dView from the other side of the canyon\u201d />\r\n<span>View from the other side of the canyon</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nWe made our way back to the main park area, and this is where the main surprise happened. I had no idea there would be so many attractions. In the back of my mind I was a little worried because I needed to take a bus back to Medellin later that night, and the bus schedule was not readily available for the route between Bucaramanga and Medellin. There was so much to see, and I was worried I might be stranded in Bucaramanga for the night.\r\n\r\nOur first stop after getting back to the main park after returning across the canyon was an area that contained little goats. I know, that doesn\u2019t sound too exciting right? But, other than the gondola ride, the goats were my favorite part of the park.\r\n\r\nI was told they were a special breed of goat that is mainly found in Santander (the state of Colombia that we were in), and they were very cute and super friendly. On top of that, for a small fee we were able to feed the goats milk.\r\n\r\nAs I was feeding the goats, I couldn\u2019t help but think of what a great idea that was from a business perspective. The clients pay to feed the goats! If only everything were that easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/cabritas.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha cabrita goat\u201d title=\u201dCabritas!

Ironically, it was young goat meat! For the first time in my life, I felt a little strange eating meat. Those little guys (I guess I could use the word \u201ckids\u201d in this case?) were so cute, and now I was eating them. But, it was some of the best meat I\u2019ve ever eaten, so I couldn\u2019t complain too much.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, we began to ascend the well-groomed paths and stairs. I was expecting the spectacular views, but I was not expecting the special ambiance of the park, including the building styles.\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/entrance.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha architecture arcitectura\u201d title=\u201dArchitecture of Chicamocha Park\u201d />\r\n<span>Architecture of Chicamocha Park</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nWe continued walking up the park, gaining elevation.

However, we were not done with the attractions. Four of us decided to do the zipline, while the others split off to do their own thing for a little bit.\r\n\r\nWe met back up with the rest at a small zoo. There were some exotic small birds, a condor, an ostrich, some geese, and a couple ponies which Sofi enjoyed riding around the small zoo.\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/chicamocha/sofi.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia chicamocha\u201d title=\u201dSofi riding the pony.

Chicamocha Canyon is on the way to Bogota, so Andrea and her family continued down the road (for 7 more hours!) to Bogota, and I returned to Bucaramanga with Leonardo, Maya, and Maya\u2019s family.

Because we didn\u2019t need to be ready until 4pm, there wasn\u2019t too much urgency in the morning hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an interesting/delicious breakfast that I\u2019m not sure how to explain, we moseyed around the house for a bit before Andrea, Angelica and I went to find some shoes for <b>someone</b> (Andrea), since that <b>someone</b> had forgotten her shoes in Bogota :-) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucaramanga is known for their shoes. They manufacture the majority of shoes in Colombia, and the area that we had gone consisted o blocks upon blocks of <u>only</u> shoe stores. After about 30 stores, we finally found the right shoes and took a taxi back to the house to eat lunch and get ready for the wedding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house was filled with about 25 family members, and 2 hours before it was time to head to the wedding, everyone was bustling around getting ready. Finally, at 4pm, it was time to go to the church for the wedding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ceremony was both similar and different than what I\u2019m accustomed to. Colombia is a heavily catholic country, and the wedding was more religious than some of the more \u201creligiousy\u201d weddings I have been to in the states. I was not surprised at all, that was about what I had expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/bucaramanga/weddingaisle.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia bucaramanga wedding\u201d title=\u201dLeonardo and Maya walking down the aisle\u201d>\r\n<span>Leonardo and Maya walking down the aisle</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a beautiful wedding ceremony, and next up was the reception, a.k.a., the fun part!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The venue was awesome! It was on a street with a bunch of walled off areas that I can best describe by comparing to mini-resort courtyards. Hopefully that makes at least a little sense? It consisted of a long, elegant pool, which was beside a large, white canopy with about 20 tables and a large dance floor in the middle. All the decor, atmosphere and ambiance were exquisite.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/bucaramanga/reception.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia bucaramanga wedding matrimonio\u201d title=\u201dWedding reception\u201d>\r\n<span>The Wedding Reception in Bucaramanga Colombia</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Live music flowed all night, which was quite amazing and I absolutely loved all of it. It started out with some slower, romantic music while everyone was arriving and getting settled in. After the venue began to fill, the music changed to mainly salsa and merengue, which is when the dancing commenced and energy began to flow through the fiesta.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/bucaramanga/guayabera.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia bucaramanga guayabera wedding\u201d title=\u201dIn my guayabera with Angelica\u201d>\r\n<span>In my guayabera with Angelica. The pictures with Andrea turned out great too, but she doesn\u2019t let me post any!</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I can\u2019t stress enough how beautiful latin dancing is. I love it. I\u2019m addicted. I\u2019m fairly confident I was the only extranjero (foreigner) there, so, like 98% of extranjeros I stood out like a sore thumb on the dance floor, but it\u2019s highly acceptable, and always leads to a wonderful night :-) The important thing is that I improved a lot that night, thanks to some guided help from my friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were all starving, and finally the food came. After taking about an hour break from dancing to eat dinner, the music resumed. This time, it was even more upbeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>La hora de Locos started and that means that people put on bright-colored masks, necklaces, hats, fake ties, and probably a few other accessories that I\u2019m forgetting. Also, other than salsa and merengue, they started mixing in some reggaeton and songs that were aimed towards group dancing. I was quite impressed with the musical agenda and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few hours of dancing, sipping on glasses of whisky, and drinking \u201cwater\u201d that had an identical taste of aguardiente (typical Colombian liquor that tastes like peppermint schnapps), it was time to go home. The live band played music until 2am, and then naturally, when they stopped playing, it was time to go. When that happened, I looked around and the place was mostly empty. I hadn\u2019t realized how empty it was because our group of cousins were the main group of dancers at that late hour and I lost track of what was going on outside of the dance floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We gathered our belongings, figured out how everyone was getting home, and then made our way back to the house. I fell asleep within about 5 minutes, and woke up when we arrived. After getting into the house, we were exhausted and immediately went to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day was a fairly lazy day around the house. We explored the neighborhood for about 30 minutes, but nothing else happened until around 2pm when we went to a close pueblo called Jiron.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/bucaramanga/jiron.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia jiron\u201d title=\u201dWalking through Jiron Colombia\u201d>\r\n<span>Walking through Jiron Colombia</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We got into Jiron and stopped to eat many large plates of various types of grilled meats and potatoes.

These ants are famous around Bucaramanga, and so I definitely needed to try some. Surprisingly, they actually weren\u2019t that bad! However, my chilean roommates do not share the same opinion on the quality of the hormigas culonas...</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/bucaramanga/jironplaza.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia bucaramanga jiron\u201d title=\u201dPlaza central in Jiron\u201d>\r\n<span>Central Plaza in Jiron</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/bucaramanga/hormigasculonas.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia bucaramanga hormigas ants\u201d title=\u201dlas hormigas culonas\u201d>\r\n<span>Las hormigas culonas, or \u201dbig-assed ants\u201d</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Back down the hill through a different street, we made our way back to the cars to head back to Bucaramanga and call it a day.

Bogot\u00e1 has a law called \u201cPico y Placa\u201d which limits the amount of cars that can drive during rush-hour. I believe it cuts down half the cars by only allowing cars with license plates that end in an even number to drive, and on the other days the license plate has to end in an odd number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, on this day, we were not allowed to drive between 3pm and 7pm within city limits of Bogot\u00e1. We were in the center of the city for my friend\u2019s graduation, and we ended up leaving at about 1:45, and still needed to pick up luggage at the house. There was not enough time to do that and then escape Bogot\u00e1 before our time ran out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to have Roberto (the dad of the family) drive north of the city and he would wait for us there, out of the city bounds of Bogot\u00e1. We would eat lunch, head to the house to get the bags, and then take a taxi to the north of the city. Sounds like a good plan, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was only one problem. We didn\u2019t have any keys to get into the house, and Roberto had already left. To make things worse, we weren\u2019t able to get ahold of Roberto. So, I decided to go to the north of the city via Transmilenio (bus system in Bogot\u00e1 with its own lanes), find Roberto to get the keys to the house, and then head back to the house to meet up with Mile and her mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love these types of adventures! Mile and her mom were stressed out and undecisive and I\u2019m curious what would have happened if I weren\u2019t there. To me, we only had one option, so it was a simple decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went all the way to the north of the city, and then arrived  to the house before Mile and her mom. They arrived and began changing their clothes (we were previously at the graduation) and packing their bags. I found out that Mile\u2019s friend Angelica would be joining us in the trip to Bucaramanga. After Angelica (Mile\u2019s friend) and I watched the first half of the Colombia vs Chile World Cup qualifier game, everyone was ready to head north to meet up with Roberto and finally head to Bucaramanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The taxi arrived, we loaded our bags, and we headed north. After finding Roberto, we loaded up into the car and began the 9 hour trek up to Bucaramanga. The graduation ended at 1:30, but we didn\u2019t leave Bogot\u00e1 until after 6pm!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drive from Bogot\u00e1 to Bucaramanga is a stunning drive. Unfortunately, we drove completely in the dark, and wouldn\u2019t find out how beautiful the drive was until a few days later while making the drive back through the Chicamocha Canyon, which I\u2019ll be writing about at a later time. Although, for now you can see the pictures in my <a href='https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5935014575535462417' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Chicamocha Canyon Google+ album</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rolled up into Bucaramanga at the bright hour of 2:30am, and then chaos ensued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently there was another family that showed up before us and were sleeping in a room that Leonardo had thought his parents would sleep in. However, the good news was that they had colchonetas (sleeping mats) set up for all of us in the main room. The parents decided it would be best to sleep in the car and didn\u2019t want to be an inconvenience, however after a few calls from Leonardo pleading that everything was fine, they were finally convinced to go to the house and we could sleep on the colchonetas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New problem - no one knew where he lived! We had the address, but no one had looked to see how to get there nor had any idea of where to go. This is something that I was now accustomed to with this family, it was now the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recruited the help of a questionable taxi driver who took us over to the neighborhood and we proceeded to drive around in search of the address. A few calls later, we found out we had the wrong address. All the locals who said that Carrera 39A didn\u2019t exist were right. It didn\u2019t exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was now almost 4am, we had the correct address and were in the correct neighborhood of Bucaramanga. After meandering the streets for about 20 minutes more, we were super close to the house. We were on the correct street, but were 2 avenues away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then we decided to give up and sleep in the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was quite confused why we would have tried so hard to find the house, but then decided to give up while being so close. But, I just took it with a grain of salt and the 5 of us tried to get comfortable in the small coupe and tried to go to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was even more confused why we would park on a main thoroughfare with noisy cars passing us at least every minute. Also, we decided to park in front of a structure that was playing loud music. It was hot. It was humid. I hadn\u2019t eaten since lunch the previous day, 16 hours prior. I was sick with an intestinal parasite which gave me diarrhea and brutal stomachaches for the previous 3-4 days. I felt the uncomfortable sensation rise up in my gut. I began to sweat. I knew there was no chance I would be able to sleep the remaining few hours of the night, and after about 15 minutes I knew I couldn\u2019t last any longer in the car. I felt like I was going crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m usually all for adventures like this, but with my sickness and hunger, it just would not be possible on this night. After gathering my phone and wallet I said I needed to find a taxi and was going to sleep in a hotel or hostel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After informing them of my departure, we decided to continue the search. They didn\u2019t want to keep calling Leonardo because it was about 4am at this point, and his wedding was the next day. I offered to get us to the house and explained how close we were, but then they decided to call Leonardo one last time. Leonardo came out of the house to walk to the main street which we were on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprise surprise, he showed up within a couple minutes on the corner 2 avenues below us. We had made it. Now everything would be great and we could go into the house and sleep on the colchonetas right? Wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We parked in front of the house, but found out there were 3 large colchonetas. The girls (Mile and Angelica) offered to sleep in the car while the other 3 of us could sleep inside. The parents then decided they didn\u2019t want to enter the house at this hour and disturb the rest of the house, and they also didn\u2019t want to make the girls to sleep in the car. Ok\u2026 then the girls and I will go in and the parents can sleep in the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nope, we then decided to drive around a bit more and search for a hotel to sleep in for the next couple hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was utterly confused at this point, as was Leonardo. The logic of the past few hours made absolutely no sense to me. I love the family and they have been so great to me, but the previous few hours I just did not understand. After driving a small block, the parents came to the conclusion it would be dumb to get a hotel at this hour. Everyone agreed, and had been saying the same thing previously. We returned back to the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"related-post text-center\">\r\n<img class=\"related-img\" src=\"/static/img/blogposts/receptiondancing.jpg\">\r\n<span class=\"related-caption\"><h4>Related Post: <a href=\"../post/14/journey-to-bucaramanga-part2\" target=\"_blank\">Bucaramanga (part 2)</a></h4></span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The girls and I entered the house, and the parents were still consistent that they were fine sleeping in the car and didn\u2019t want to enter the house and disturb the rest of the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We made it.

Their main goal is to fight poverty throughout Latin America and improve the lives of those who are affected by social injustice and inequality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This weekend I finally had the privilege of helping out with construction of a family in need here in Colombia, and the experience was everything I had hoped for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started out by meeting at 6pm at Parque de los Deseos (Park of Wishes) and after a few hours of process, instruction, and watching inspirational videos, we embarked off to our destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 150 people, the logistics are always going to be tricky, but the management volunteers of Techo clearly had practiced a lot and had things well under control. There were 3 different \u201cschools\u201d that volunteers of Techo Medellin would stay in, and each of the schools were in different locations. People were assigned to certain buses that would go to certain schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drive was not smooth. We climbed up the steep hills on the west side of the city up to the neighborhood of Santo Domingo. And then we went further. And further. We ran into a \u201cminor\u201d problem in Santo Domingo when another bus was stuck on a narrow bridge. After a delay of more than half an hour, we decided to try and squeeze through. I had my head poking out the window on my side, and there was less than an inch of space. Literally, less than an inch. On the other side, it looked to be something similar, but I didn\u2019t have a good angle to see it exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finally arrived to our school, settled in, ate \"dinner\" at 12:30am, and then finally went to bed around 2am so that we could wake up three and a half hours later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We might not have had much sleep, but I was full of energy and ready to start the day. We had some breakfast, gathered our stuff, and then set off to the locations to build the houses. I was one of three guys who volunteered to help unload the main truck, so we set off a little before the main group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn\u2019t know it was going to be that hard! Unloading the truck was quite tedious and consisted of moving fully-built, heavy sidings of the houses, doors, and numerous other planks. We didn\u2019t just unload once, we had to unload so that we could get to the back t unload some stuff, and then re-load half the materials back in. And then we went to another location, and did the same thing. It was tough work, but was also enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we finished unloading, the rest of the crew showed up. Then it was time to carry all of the supplies up to the house locations. We\u2019re talking steep inclines that are dirt/mud paths. This part was not simple either, but we got the job done and the six houses were ready to be started at around 11am.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/techo/viewfromhouse.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin techo mountains scenery\u201d title=\u201dView from the house\u201d>\r\n<span>View from the house</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Our house had some \u201cminor\u201d setbacks, the first being a <b>huge</b> boulder that took all our strength and effort for well over an hour. We decided it was best to push it over a small ledge, even though it would most likely break the siding of the house or bathroom below. Those structures were part of the family who we were building this new Techo house for, and they encouraged us to do it. Our fear came true, and the boulder put a hole in the side of the bathroom, but we were finally successful in removing the boulder from the house site.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/techo/therock.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin techo\u201d title=\u201dHuge boulder we needed to move\u201d>\r\n<span>Huge boulder we needed to move</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We then had the terrain cleared, and would spend the rest of the day putting in the large posts that the house would use as its foundation.

There were <b>so</b> many rocks which put a heavy delay on the construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nighttime ensued, and the school leaders came up to inform us that we were the last group to come down, and semi-politely told us to hurry up. So, we quickly gathered our tools, and embarked down the muddy trails in pure darkness, but had a few flashlights to aid us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all got home, and were exhausted. What a tough day!

We did the breakfast routine, packed our bags, did some stretching, and then went off to the house sites for a final day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, at least that is what we hoped. Usually after the first day, you want to have the floors fully installed. We, and the other groups, were well short of that. The problem - very rocky terrain. Clearing out the ground to put in the posts was a pain, and took so long because of the rocks. Would we finish the houses in time? I was informed that this was <u>not</u> normal, and so I was a bit concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/techo/foundation.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin techo\u201d title=\u201dBuilding the foundation\u201d>\r\n<span>Only a few posts left!</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We ended up installing the last posts, setting the floor, and getting 3 out of the 6 walls up before 12:30, when we went to have lunch with the family. The family made some amazing traditional lunches and it was super delicious both days. What an amazing family, hearing about the life stories really makes you feel fortunate for what you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/techo/viewfrombarrio.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin techo\u201d title=\u201dView from the neighborhood\u201d>\r\n<span>Not a bad view, eh?</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We ate lunch quickly because we knew we were pressed for time. We headed back to the house site, and started working on the last walls. We finished the walls, set the costaneras (planks going side to side?) and then set the vigas (main planks?). After that, we began constructing the roof, with a layer of insulation, and then the metal roof. At the same time, we were also installing the door, and 2 windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/techo/finishingroof.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin techo\u201d title=\u201dFinishing the roof\u201d>\r\n<span>Almost done</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We ended up finishing at about 5:30pm, just in time for darkness to shroud our vision.

Luckily, the bus went to a metro station, and then onto the office of Techo Medellin, which is near where I live.

It\u2019s a serious problem. I\u2019m <b>always</b> thinking ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know, I know, how is that a problem? Let me explain!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking ahead isn\u2019t always a bad thing. It\u2019s gotten me far in life, and I\u2019ve been able to accomplish many goals. I have so many positive things in my life, and much of it can be attributed to my long-term vision and life strategies I put on myself. I rarely just relax and take the easy road when it comes to my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before this <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/2/the-south-american-dream' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>trip</a>, I told myself that I am done living in the future and I am going to start living in the present. I quickly found out that is just not my style of living :) On the bright side, I am now happy with the present, but excited about the future. That is different than how I was living previously, when I was not happy at all with the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, how could I not be happy living in beautiful <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/10/first-impressions-of-medellin' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Medellin Colombia</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Building my Custom Home</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One major turning point in my life was when I was building my house. I was 24 years old and having a beautiful custom home built, how incredible is that? </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/GameOfLife/house.JPG' alt=\u201dhouse casa honda civic stucco modern\u201d title=\u201dMy House\u201d>\r\n<span>My house in Richland, WA, USA</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s not just a normal home, it\u2019s full of wonderful upgrades (a.k.a. money sinks for things that aren\u2019t necessary) and it truly is a great home which was built exactly to my needs. Or should I say, to my wants?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day during the construction, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that I was thinking things like \u201cOk, for this home I\u2019ll get this hardwood floor because it has the most value, but for my next home I\u2019m going to get a better hardwood floor\u201d. Really?! My wallet wasn\u2019t big enough for my 100s, and my diamond shoes were too tight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was already subconsciously thinking about my next home, and reality struck me. Why was I in this endless cycle of wanting more and how could I escape? Why wasn\u2019t I thinking about the home right in front of me?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Moving to Colombia</h3>\r\n<p>After the epiphany about my house struck me, I immediately started to re-evaluate what I was doing with my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It just so happened, in those times I was just starting to learn <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/3/the-power-of-spanish' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Spanish</a> and was also falling in love with <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/4/why-colombia' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Colombia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next 2 years, I was planning on living in Colombia and/or traveling throughout South America. Those were tough years to stay in my hometown, but I accomplished what I needed, and now as I <u>hope</u> you know, I am able to live my life and <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/6/finding-your-travel-style' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>travel in my own style</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Moving up the corporate ladder</h3>\r\nIn my previous (and only) job, we had a level-based system for my job category. Employees would be level 1, level 2, etc and the best employees would eventually get up to level 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, during my last year I was promoted from level 1 to level 2. I had a great year, and I played my cards right to get the promotion. The interesting thing is that before I was even level 2, I was already thinking about how quickly I could get promoted to level 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I even took it a step further. There seemed to be quite a few level 4s, but only a couple level 5s. Because of that, my long-term vision was to get up to a level 4 quickly, and then I would be content at that level. I didn\u2019t think too much about what I needed to get to a level 5, and to be honest, I\u2019m not even sure if I would want to take on the extra responsibility. But, that would have been far down the road and many things would have changed by then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The important thing to note from this example is that I look at life as a game. I love when people tell me something is impossible. I love difficult challenges, and I\u2019m always thinking ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What am I thinking about now?</h2>\r\nRight now, and in the past year, I am contemplating ways to live a sustainable long-term travel life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ironic thing is that I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s what I want for my life. However, I find it to be difficult goal, and the endless options occupy my mind. <b>I solely find joy in figuring this out, and solving this problem.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me tell you, it\u2019s not an easy one. Many people try to live a life of long-term travel, and very few figure out ways to make it work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through research, I\u2019ve found travelers who use an array of different techniques to live a sustainable life. Some people <a href='http://www.wanderingearl.com/wandering-earl-tours/' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>conduct tours</a>. Some people sell <a href='http://medellinliving.com/medellin-travel-guide/' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>travel guide books</a>. Some people have <a href='http://jasminestephenson.com/' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>online technology consulting</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other options as well, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how I can fit into this world. Through the next year(s), I will be experimenting with different techniques, searching for something that is both enjoyable and sustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Are my options skewed?</h2>\r\nI woke up one morning and thought that maybe my choices are being limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most intriguing things I learned in college was in my first year, and it has stuck with me ever since. Media is super powerful, and can change entire countries. People only know what they read and hear. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve been reading travel blogs of people who generally left their home country with very little to their name but have managed to find a sustainable lifestyle.\r\nThe ideas that I have read about have came from travel bloggers who have found some niche where they can sell a product or good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, are my options skewed? I\u2019m different. I\u2019m my own unique person. Do I need to limit myself into options that are generally taken by travel bloggers, or can I use my own strengths, experience, education, and creativity to find something that is a better fit for me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any ideas, please share in the comments below, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!f</p>\r\n", "category": 3, "views": 418, "headline": "I have a problem.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more beautiful city in my life, and I\u2019ve seen quite a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most amazingly beautiful things about Medellin are the streets. They are lined with all sorts of exotic trees, and just walking through the simplest of streets brings great joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Impression/MedellinSt1.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin street calle plants plantas tree arbol\u201d title=\u201dStreets of Medellin Colombia\u201d>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Impression/MedellinSt2.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin street calle plants plantas tree arbol\u201d title=\u201dStreets of Medellin Colombia\u201d>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Impression/MedellinSt3.jpg' alt=\u201dcolombia medellin street calle plants plantas tree arbol\u201d title=\u201dStreets of Medellin Colombia\u201d>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s not that there were a few cool streets so I took some pics.

A couple friends from the hostel and I took a ride up both of the sides of the valley, and the views did not disappoint. They did not disappoint one bit.

If you\u2019re from where I\u2019m from, no, this does not mean it\u2019s March weather with high winds, ranges from 30-70 degrees and with chances of hail or snow. It\u2019s more like May. The weather is almost always between 65 and 85 during the day and the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nights are calm and around 70 degrees - perfect. Even last night it was raining and I was 100% comfortable walking in the paisa rain under an umbrella wearing only the normal jeans and T-shirt. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The days are around 80 degrees on average - perfect. This type of weather really escalates my mood and makes it tough to be cranky. I\u2019m not sure how much else I can say about the weather, I can\u2019t imagine better weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Paisa Women</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There\u2019s quite a bit to read about the women of Medellin, and the expectations were set high. For the people who know me well, they know I have been almost solely into Colombian women (with the exception of some other latinas) for the past couple years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I honestly didn\u2019t think it would get any better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s a little ridiculous, and at times it doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s astonishing the percentage of women here who are extremely attractive. I\u2019m still trying to figure it out, but from what I know it\u2019s just part of their culture to look a certain way and to value physical looks higher than other cultures. I\u2019ve read that it dates back to the 1990\u2019s when there was a lot of money flow through Medellin generated from a certain crop and the women picked up a trait of having high value in their looks to impress the higher ups. I\u2019m not exactly sure if it actually started then or if it was a pre-existing trait here in Medellin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medellin is famous for its women, and it is especially known to travelers and expats. To be honest, that reputation makes me a little uncomfortable because it\u2019s almost assumed that if you\u2019re a single guy in your 20\u2019s you\u2019re going to Medellin just for the women. Because of that stereotype, I almost didn\u2019t even want to come to Medellin. Colombia will always mean so much more to me, and I really do not want to be put into that stereotype.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I came to Medellin, and the women truly are stunning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>If Medellin only had 2 of these 3 characteristics I feel it would still be at the top of the list of places I would want to live in Colombia.

Some of the highlights of my time in Bogota were finally meeting Andrea and her family, working in the store of Andrea\u2019s family, going to <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/8/weekend-in-tunja-colombia' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Tunja</a> and <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/7/colombian-countryside-journey' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Chiquinquira</a> to meet family of Andrea, and just simply commuting around Bogota (including taking the wrong bus and ending up in a very bad part of town, don\u2019t tell mom please!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrea\u2019s family was amazing, and they were so generous and hospitable. Having a supportive family like that is such a relief for me while I travel, and I know that I always have support when I go to Bogota.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taking the Next Steps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As great as my stay in Bogota was, my journey will not always be like that. I will not always have tinto and juice ready for me when I wake up, nor will I have meals constantly prepared for me. I will not always have a place to call home, nor a family to support me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step on my journey will be in Medellin, Colombia. In Medellin I plan to get a room in a shared apartment and live a more normal life - you know, minus the whole mandatory work schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look forward to cooking my own food, finding my own way, and thriving with more independence. It is something I\u2019m comfortable with, and it allows me to grow more rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What will Medellin really be like?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been reading Colombian travel blogs for over 2 years. A couple summers ago, I became obsessed with Colombia, and the country itself became an influential part of my life. The three most memorable blogs I have read are <a href='http://jasminewanders.com' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Jasmine Wanders</a>, <a href='http://medellinliving.com' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Medellin Living</a>, and <a href='http://ryangoesabroad.com' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Ryan Goes Abroad</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don\u2019t feel like checking these blogs out, I will save you some time - all three of these travel bloggers live in the city of Medellin, Colombia. You may ask, what is it about the city that attracts these travelers? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I have my ideas, and I know why these people have liked Medellin, but over the next few months I will let you know more about how I feel about the city of Medellin, as well as surrounding areas. I\u2019m trying to keep my expectations under control. What will Medellin <b>really</b> be like?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s interesting to think about how much blogs have influenced me over the past years, and how they have shaped my life. I started out learning spanish, then I progressed to Colombia, and then I moved onto wanting a nomadic lifestyle focused in Colombia.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>What do I want from Medellin?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A question that I constantly have to ask myself is what is it that I\u2019m after. In Medellin, what do I want to accomplish? What is it that I want to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few things that come to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>1. Volunteer work</h4>\r\n<p>Since I will be spending up to 5 months in Medellin, I will have time to settle down for some volunteer work. An organization I have been following for a while is called Un techo para mi Pais (A roof for my Country) and they work on building houses, schools, and other establishments in poverty stricken areas throughout Latin America. I am also in contact with an organizer for a program that helps children in areas with high poverty in Medellin. As you can see, my goals with my volunteer work are to help improve the poverty situation in Colombia. Ever since I started learning about Colombia, I have wanted to help out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Find a simple job</h4>\r\n<p>I\u2019m trying hard not to get serious and start looking for real jobs, but sometimes, believe it or not, that is one of the most difficult things for me to do. I would like to do something simple to earn a little bit of income. I would like to do something with a lot of personal interaction. The only option that I have thought seriously about is being a personal trainer, but I know other situations will pop up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>3. Figure out where I want to live</h4>\r\n<p>After my journey, the tentative plan is to move back to Colombia to live for an extended period of time. I don\u2019t really like to talk about my tentative plan after the World Cup because it truly is super tentative, but I will break my rule in this post. I\u2019ve gotten to know the Caribbean coast, Bogota and areas of Boyaca. Next up is Medellin and the coffee triangle which is south of Medellin. After these areas, I will know where I would want to set up shop in Colombia and return back to a semi-normal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>4. Be happy</h4>\r\n<p>Among everything else, the main reason for this trip is to be happy. In this phase of my life, that happiness is found through living a simple life, and gaining new experiences. No matter what I do in Medellin, everything is in the pursuit of happiness.</p>\r\n", "category": 4, "views": 409, "headline": "As great as my stay in Bogota was, my journey will not always be like that.", "image": "blogposts/monserrate.jpg", "title": "From Bogota to Medellin", "img_alt": "monserrate, bogota, colombia, travel, mountains, iglesia, church", "post_date": "2013-09-15", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Monserrate above Bogota, Colombia"}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>I spent most of the weekend in the beautiful Tunja, Colombia with Andrea, her aunts and uncles, and her cousins. We worked in her family store on Saturday until about 5 p.m. so we didn\u2019t end up getting into Tunja until around 10 p.m. after some delays from escaping the Bogot\u00e1 traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tunja is a city of about 225,000 people is and is high up in the mountains of Boyac\u00e1 at 9,250 feet. Upon arrival from Bogot\u00e1, you're at the top of a mountain ridge and the final destination requires going down into a valley which acts as Tunja\u2019s floor. It\u2019s not like typical cities which I am accustomed to where the city is based on the floor of a valley - it is actually situated on the steep hillside and extends down into the valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got off the bus near the neighborhood where most of Andrea\u2019s family lives and were quickly greeted by her cousin Lucia and her cousin\u2019s boyfriend Pedro. After dropping off our bags, we decided to go out to dance and drink a few beers coupled with some Aguardiente. Aguardiente is the go-to hard alcohol in Colombia and the best I can explain it is that it tastes like a \u201cminty vodka\u201d. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dancing in Berlin</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We took a taxi and ended up at a night club/discoteca/bar named Berlin. Berlin is on the 5th floor of a building close to the center of the city, which had a stunning view overlooking the valley and the rest of the city up on the hillside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They played a mix of Reggaeton, Salsa, Electronic, American Pop, and some older stuff that I\u2019m not too sure how to classify. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I quickly remembered how much I enjoy latin dance. As you may have heard, latin dancing is quite different from the dancing in the states. It\u2019s something that is quite challenging, especially since I started when I was 24 and everyone here knows how to dance to all the latin rhythms before they exit the womb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching good salsa dancers is <b>beautiful</b>. The rhythm, the closeness, and the connection form dancing which is magical. I can almost hold my own for a gringo (at least that\u2019s what people tell me, I think they lie though), but it is an art and each time I practice I can feel myself getting better. Someday I hope to dance like the Colombians, but I\u2019m starting to think it is something similar to my accent in Spanish and I will never be able to completely transform.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Tunja/berlin.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca tunja night view city lights\" title=\"View from Berlin Nightclub in Tunja Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nView from the Berlin Nightclub\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing off the half bottle of Boyacense Aguardiente and a few beers, it was 2am and it was time to head home. We proceeded to walk down the hill towards the house while having some very interesting conversation about legends of Tunja and learning some words/phrases that aren\u2019t supposed to be repeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We stopped into a restaurant called El Rey and got some food before finishing the trek back to the house. Apparently caldo (broth) is the Colombian version of Denny\u2019s or any greasy food. It\u2019s known here to sober you up, and also is the go-to cure for hangovers. I was feeling perfect, and decided to go with the chicken and french fries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After adding some food to our stomachs, we finished the 2 mile walk home to Andrea\u2019s.aunt\u2019s house. It\u2019s quite refreshing to walk through the fresh, clean mountain air of Tunja in the middle of the night. It also definitely is more adventurous and interesting than getting a ride home, especially when you\u2019re in a foreign land speaking Spanish the whole time!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exploring Tunja</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and was ready for the day. As soon as I got up, Andrea\u2019s aunt Etel had the customary coffee and juice ready, and then began to cut up the fresh fruit, make eggs with salchicha (more or less sausage, I think), and prepare the hot chocolate and fresh bread. This is the typical breakfast up in the Colombian mountains, and it is delicious. Also, this is the customary service, and it\u2019s something I am definitely getting used to!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of the cousins woke up and joined me for a leisurely breakfast while we waited for Andrea and another cousin to join us from the other aunt\u2019s house which is just down the block. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Andrea and her other cousin arrived, the 5 of us off to explore the city of Tunja. We walked through the streets of central Tunja looking through elegant churches, luscious gardens, and the entrances of historical museums. We didn\u2019t go into the museums because they cost money to enter, and we decided there were better things to do for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Tunja/garden.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca tunja garden jardin plants plantas\" title=\"Garden in Tunja Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nGarden near central Tunja\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We ended just before lunchtime and sat in the main plaza eating some refreshing treats that are the same as Otter Pops. After the Otter Pops were depleted, it was time to head home for lunch. We walked home again, through the same street that some of us had walked the night before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we arrived to Andrea\u2019s aunt\u2019s house, other family started to pour in. Their grandma, a few other aunts and uncles and a few more cousins joined us and we all ate a delicious lunch together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrea\u2019s family is super close, the closest family I have ever seen. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s one big family instead of 4 separate families, I\u2019m not sure how I can explain it with words. Colombian families are already close, but Andrea\u2019s family takes it a step further. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously a lot of it has to do with how the Andrea\u2019s mom\u2019s family was raised, but it also helps that there are about 10 cousins who are between the ages of 21 and 26, as well as 3 of the families living a few blocks away from each other in Tunja. Experiencing their family culture and customs is something that has immediately impacted me and something I will truly miss when I move further away to Medellin, Colombia later this week. They\u2019ve accepted me into their family and everyone is so friendly and caring towards me - it is something special.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Family Fun Activities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch was over, we had a tough decision to make. Should we go play Tejo or should we go play soccer? Tejo is a traditional Colombian game which involves throwing rocks onto a slanted board and trying to hit the target which has some explosive gunpowder. I\u2019ve read about it quite a bit, but have yet to play it. As you can probably guess from the last sentence, we decided to go play football with about 10 members of the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing soccer with the family was a great experience. We ended up playing 4 on 4 which consisted of people of all skill levels, spanning a couple generations and involving guys and girls. Some of us played in jeans, running shoes, long sleeve shirts, and it was a unique and enjoyable experience. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was obviously casual but there was also a little competitive edge at the same time. Most importantly, it involved a lot of laughing! Playing football with the family is part of their culture and is another thing I wouldn\u2019t mind incorporating into my life in the future. Reason #348 why I love Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It felt fantastic to be running around again. One thing that I will change quickly when I move to Medellin is my workout schedule. I miss working out and exercise - besides walking around, I haven\u2019t exercised at all for almost 2 weeks. However, let me tell you, playing soccer is quite different at 9,200+ feet versus the 300 feet to which my body is accustomed to. I ran around like normal for the first couple minutes but then after the sensation of needing to vomit presented itself, I decided to turn it down. I didn\u2019t want to give gringo soccer a bad name!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team ended up victorious winning the hard-fought, defensive match which ended up 12-10 after about 40 minutes. When the match was over, we packed up our stuff and headed back across the street to our neighborhood. On the way home we ran into a friend of the family and decided to spend the evening playing a Spanish pictionary game which he had and the family enjoyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m usually terrible at pictionary, but I feel like I ended up doing better than usual. The only word I completely blanked on drawing was \u201cQuality\u201d. How the hell are you supposed to draw \u201cQuality\u201d! Luckily it was one of only a few words that none of the teams could guess correctly before the time ran out, so I didn\u2019t feel too bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Tunja/pinto_grafic.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca tunja spanish pictionary pinto grafic\" title=\"Playing Spanish Pictionary with the family\">\r\n<span>\r\nPlaying Spanish Pictionary with the family\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I would love to play the game again because I learned <b>so</b> many new words. Coupling new words with drawing them helps immensely for retention, and I think I remember about 80-90% of the words that I learned on that night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team took a sizable lead and were only a few spaces away from winning, but another team made a comeback to steal the victory from us. Oh well, at least we won the football match!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After pictionary was done, we were all mentally drained, and decided to call it a night. For some of us, this was amplified by the fact that we had gotten home at 4 a.m. the night before which meant we only slept about 4 hours before embarking upon the beautiful day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We headed back to the other aunt\u2019s house, which is where we were going to sleep, and finished the night by watching some TV and a movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Day at El Mirador</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At first we had planned to only stay in Tunja for 1 night, but that turned into 2 nights in order to spend a little more time with the family as well as to allow me to get a good picture of the city. I wanted to get a picture of the city from a scenic vista, so Andrea, 3 cousins, and I took a short drive up to the ridge on the other side of the valley looking down upon Tunja. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/Tunja/tunja.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca tunja mountain hill cloud\" title=\"Viewpoint of Tunja Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nViewpoint overlooking Tunja\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was drizzling and cloudy, so the pictures didn\u2019t turn out as well as I would have liked, but it still gives a good idea of how Tunja is situated, and hopefully brings across some of the beauty of Tunja.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I accomplished getting some pictures from el mirador, we headed back into town to drop Andrea and I off at the bus station to return home.</p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had an amazing time in Tunja doing things I\u2019ve never done before and gaining insights about life. I was able to reflect quite a bit about what my life is turning into and am excited for the next few months as I switch into a new phase of <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/2/the-south-american-dream' target='_blank'>my journey</a> where I become more self-sufficient and have more independent experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experience with Andrea\u2019s aunts, uncles, and cousins was unforgettable, and I can\u2019t wait to see them again when I go to Andrea\u2019s brother\u2019s wedding in October!</p>", "category": 4, "views": 444, "headline": "Trip to Tunja to visit with Andrea's family again as well as to explore Tunja", "image": "blogposts/tunjamirador.jpg", "title": "Weekend in Tunja Colombia", "img_alt": "tunja, colombia, viewpoint, vista, mountain, hills", "post_date": "2013-09-09", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Viewpoint in Tunja, Colombia"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>It all started at the wonderful hour of 4:30am when Andrea, her parents, her sister in-law, and I woke up to embark upon a road trip through the Colombian countryside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, the Colombian countryside around Bogot\u00e1 is beautiful.

However, the preparation ended up taking about 4 hours. For lunch we made a stew of chicken, potatoes, and yuca which was cooked on top of a wood fire which was sheltered under an interesting shack.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/CampoColombiano/stew.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca chiquinquira stew fire cooking chicken\" title=\"Cooking Stew in Chiquinquira Boyaca Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nCooking the stew containing chicken, potatoes, and yuca\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After the stew was cooking on the fire, we headed to the market to pick up some fresh produce. The region we were in (Boyac\u00e1) is known for its agriculture. So, that means that the fruit and vegetables were super fresh straight from the farms. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/CampoColombiano/mercado.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca chiquinquira mercado market marketplace fruit vegetable frutas verduras\" title=\"Marketplace in Chiquinquira Boyaca Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nMarketplace in Chiquinquira\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We spent about a half an hour in the market and acquired a large bag (about 40 pounds I would say) of fresh produce, as well as a separate bag full of mandarin oranges. The stew was not being watched, so we heading back to the finca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stew took a while to cook, but time always passes very well when talking Spanish. Lunch was about ready, and then the surprise cake for my birthday came. As many people close to me know (including Andrea), I do not like my birthday. I was hoping that Andrea would forget that it was my birthday, and I <u>thought</u> I was in the clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, they decided to surprise me with a cake, and it was really sweet of her to arrange that.  In the end, I enjoyed the cake, and especially the surprise. The fact that she knew I don\u2019t like my birthday and hid it so well was very sneaky of her, but it paid off. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/CampoColombiano/cake.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca chiquinquira birthday cake\" title=\"Landscape near Chiquinquira Boyaca Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nSurprise birthday cake\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it was time for lunch. We extracted the chicken, potatoes, and yuca. Everything smelled amazing, and it tasted even better. What a great lunch!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/CampoColombiano/finishedstew.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca chiquinquira stew fire chicken pollo gallina\" title=\"Finished Stew in Chiquinquira Boyaca Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nTaking the chicken out of the stew with Andrea's dad\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch we went over to the main plaza of Chiquinquir\u00e1 and checked out their church as well as a museum. If you aren\u2019t aware, pretty much all cities in Latin America have a central plaza with an enormous church. I\u2019ve seen a bunch of these churches/plazas, and I\u2019ve definitely lost interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We walked back through the intriguing streets of Chiquinquir\u00e1 and returned to the finca. It was getting late, and we still wanted to go to Tunja to visit with a couple other aunts of Andrea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drive from Chiquinquir\u00e1 to Tunja was the opposite of smooth. Through the pothole laden road, we continually were bouncing up and down in our seats. I\u2019m not going to lie, it was quite entertaining!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\u2019s a famous city that we drove past called Villa de Leyva. We didn\u2019t stop there because of the time, but to show the landscape we were driving through, I\u2019ll share a picture I took of the nearby pozos azules during my first trip to Colombia. Boyac\u00e1 has some beautiful country.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\u201dcontent-image\u201d>\r\n<img src='http://stepsofatraveler.com/static/img/blogposts/embed/CampoColombiano/villa.jpg' alt=\"colombia boyaca villadeleyva pozos azules monta\u00f1as mountains country campo lake pond\" title=\"Pozos Azules near Villa de Leyva Boyaca Colombia\">\r\n<span>\r\nLos Pozos Azules near Villa de Leyva\r\n</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the rough country road, we finally arrived to Tunja. What a beautiful city! I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably the most photogenic city I\u2019ve been to in Colombia. However, I have some bad news, and I have some good news. The bad news is that I didn\u2019t take any pictures of Tunja. The good news is that I\u2019m going to return on Saturday with Andrea to hang out with her family again! I definitely won\u2019t forget to take pictures this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city is down in a steep valley, and the city stretches up the hillside. It sits above 9100 feet, which is one the highest cities in Colombia. I could try to explain more about the beauty of Tunja, but it will be best to share some pictures next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrea\u2019s family is incredible. They continued to enforce my statement that <b>Colombians are the most friendly people in the world</b>. They stretch the limits of being generous, kind, social, and loving. Even though I had just met them, I was informed repeatedly that I have my own room for when I come back to Tunja.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tunja, Andrea has 3 aunts that live all within a few blocks of each other, and I was able to meet 2 of the families, and will probably meet the last one this weekend. There are about 7 cousins that live in those 3 families, and everyone is very close to each other. Tunja was an awesome experience, and I\u2019m very excited to return in a few days!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After starting our day at 4:30am, it was now almost 9pm in Tunja and we still needed to drive about 3 hours back into Bogot\u00e1. So, it was time to go.

Before I began reading travel blogs and expanding my knowledge about travel, I had a mindset that travel meant going to foreign lands, checking out all the best sites I had time for, and staying in hostels and/or hotels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This typical idea of travel satisfies the needs of people who are looking to see noteworthy sites, as well as take some stunning photos. These are the types of things that you can talk about to your friends and they will be quite impressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is not my style. It can be quite costly and can also quickly become mentally draining - both which don\u2019t work for traveling for a long time. From my experience, people naturally have this vision of travel, but are not aware of long-term travel. Long-term travel is not something that comes naturally, it is something you have to learn about. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although brilliant photos are enjoyable and necessary in my style of travel, that is not what I enjoy the most. My main mission for traveling is to experience different cultures and different ways of life, and there are many ways to accomplish that mission. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where to stay?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The \u201cgo-to option\u201d for simple travel is hostels, but I quickly found out through my travels that hostels are <b>not</b> the best way to accomplish my mission. I have naturally formed an ordered list of accommodation preferences, and that list is in no way static. I\u2019m always looking to learn about new options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, the absolute best situation is to stay with a friend, and spend time living with their family. Right now, I\u2019m a bit spoiled because I\u2019m living in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia with the family of my amazing friend I met through <a href='http://livemocha.com' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Livemocha</a> almost 2 years ago. Even though we never met in person, we maintained a good friendship through all this time, and now I am experiencing Colombian culture every minute of every hour of every day with her and her family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m making empanadas. I\u2019m speaking Spanish 99% of the time. I\u2019m learning about family customs and traditions which would be impossible to experience while staying in hostels. This is my third time in Colombia, but I\u2019ve only been here a few days during this trip and I have already learned so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this form of travel is not sustainable in the long-term. I have made a few friends in South America through Livemocha, however I will not always be able to stay with them. My next step I will be spending a few months in Medellin, and I am planning on renting a room in a shared apartment which has many of the same perks as staying with a family but is more realistic in the long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After these preferred accommodation options there are a few others that I am aware of - hostels, Couchsurfing, and volunteer work that provides living. I\u2019ve traveled quite a bit, but I have never done long-term traveling until now, so I am expecting to learn about new options or variations of the choices that I\u2019m currently aware of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, I will do anything possible to not stay in hostels. To me, the ubiquitous English is the most painful aspect of hostels. Being around other travelers and sharing interesting stories is great, but most of the time the next day they are gone. Improving my Spanish is mandatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than not being able to immerse myself in the Spanish language, hostels don\u2019t allow immersion in the local culture either. It doesn\u2019t allow to grasp reality of everyday life, it just exposes a facade presented to what travelers typically see. Staying in hostels diminishes the point of why I travel, and for that I only stay in hostels if I\u2019ve exhausted all other choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://couchsurfing.org' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Couchsurfing</a> is also a quality option, especially when only staying in places for a few days. This form of travel does lend itself to exposure in culture and language, which fulfills my main goal for traveling. Not only do you get exposure to the culture, but you also get acquainted with someone who is open to traveling and is familiar with the area. The downside for me is the length of stay. Typically anything more than 3 days is pushing the limits, and sometimes it can be tough to find a host in certain cities, especially on short-notice. If it\u2019s not short-notice, it takes delicate planning into the future, which is a no-no for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the more traditional travel phase of my <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/2/the-south-american-dream' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>journey</a>, I will inevitably be spending some nights in hostels. If Couchsurfing doesn\u2019t pan out in certain cities or towns, the only option left is hostels. I\u2019ll also be looking for certain volunteer opportunities, but at this point I haven\u2019t researched those opportunities enough to be comfortable, but I know it\u2019s a feasible option.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conflicts With Travel Goals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes I am conflicted on what I should do while on travel. I first ran into this problem on my short backpacking excursion through <a href='http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/5/colombia-or-latin-america' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Central America</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem I ran into is that I enjoy the simple things more than the exciting things. I enjoy walking through the streets and looking in stores. I enjoy learning about the real culture. I enjoy riding the buses and watching the buildings and people fly by. Most of all, I simply enjoy <b>talking</b> with locals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People want to see spectacular pictures. People want to hear breathtaking stories. But what do <b>I</b> want?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one wants to read about how amazing walking to the store \u201cAlkosto\u201d a couple nights ago with Andrea and her mom was. We walked through the dimly lit back-streets over to the busy Calle 68 in northwest Bogot\u00e1. It was eye-opening to see the sidewalks crowded with people with noises flooding in from all angles generated by the traffic, hundreds of people walking and talking, and latin music blaring from the countless stores that line the streets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This experience doesn\u2019t produce pictures, nor interesting stories. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the walk, and it is exactly what I seek in my style of travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I tell people that I\u2019m going to Peru, the first thing they ask is if I\u2019m going to go to Machu Picchu. My answer is that I will go there, but there are so many other amazing sites in Peru.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machu Picchu is obviously very photogenic and recognizable. It is also filled with tourists. There are many cases where the tourism drives me away, but Machu Picchu is something that I feel the experience will outweigh the downside of not experiencing real Peru. Barely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Machu Picchu is a necessity, and I will be going there. However, I am more excited about the simple things. I\u2019m exciting to meet up with a couple friends in Peru and see what their lives are really like. I\u2019m exciting to see the differences between Peru and Colombia. Being just a few days into the journey, nothing is set in stone. Maybe my priorities will change tomorrow? Maybe I\u2019ll have the same reason for traveling in 11 months when I\u2019m finishing up in Brazil, or maybe my reason for traveling will be completely different. Only time will tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019d like, please share in the comments below. What is your travel style?

I had researched different types of visas, looked at apartments, and even applied to a few jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I had a choice to make. Was I really ready to settle on Colombia and abandon my long-term travelling aspirations? I had dreams of living in countries for 3-6 months at a time, living a normal life, and picking up the languages and cultures. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had dreams of travelling through all of South America and seeing what else there was to offer while picking up different dialects of Spanish and different ways of living. After all, before going to Colombia the first time, I was expecting it to be similar to <i>Mexico</i>. I was very wrong. And any Colombian reading this will be upset by that statement! Were the other South American and Central American countries just as different?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Move to Colombia or Continue Exploring?</h2>\r\n<p>I had to decide whether to hold onto these dreams, or follow my heart and simply move to Colombia. It was not an easy decision, and something I thought about for the better part of a year. I had gone back and forth, and back again\u2026 and then forth\u2026 and the I was lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to Colombia is not a simple process. There are visa requirements that can be difficult to fulfill, and staying for an extended period of time takes some research, resourcefulness, and commitment. Luckily, research, resourcefulness, and commitment are some of my strong suits, but I had to ask myself if that is what I really wanted to do with these few <i>free</i> years of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was supposed to make a <b>third</b> trip to Colombia during Winter Break of 2012/2013 to check out Medellin and determine which region to move to. I ended up cancelling that trip. I figured I would return to Colombia in August no matter what, and I should check out Central America first. My rationale was that after heading to South America again would I ever really want to go to Central America? I don\u2019t think so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Central America Journey</h2>\r\n<p>My Central America trip was not something that was planned. In fact, I woke up one Sunday morning and had an urge to travel. I researched countries all day, and after Monday I found out my back-ups at work were available so I bought my plane ticket that Monday evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had 2 weeks between when I bought the ticket and when I would leave. I found out later that week that my final MBA project was not fulfilling the requirements and I needed to restart. Needless to say, things got very busy, very quickly. I\u2019m quite the resourceful person, but even I couldn\u2019t find any time to plan much for the trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heading into the Central America journey, my plan for later that year (after I finished school) was to travel all of South America doing the normal backpacking thing. I had been well-traveled, but I had never tried the traditional backpacking thing. I decided giving it a shot for 2-3 weeks in Central America before I committed to a whole year in South America was a good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Central America destinations were split between 3 countries: Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I won\u2019t be going too far into the details of that trip, but the main point of it was to see if the backpacking thing was for me. I had a <b>great</b> time in Nicaragua with a couple <a href='https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5852263734705672977/5852263735672044482' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>friends</a> I had met through Livemocha. Sofia had planned out some daytrips, and we had an <u>amazing</u> time during that first week. Based out of Managua, we took trips to various cities around Nicaragua such as Leon, Granada, Masaya, and the island of Ometepe. I thoroughly enjoyed that stage of the trip and Nicaragua was unforgettable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other parts of the trip through Costa Rica and Panama were the <i>real</i> backpacking portions of the trip. I was on my own doing the typical backpacking thing. I was staying in hostels, <a href='http://couchsurfing.org' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>couchsurfing</a>, and not knowing exactly where I would end up the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, I didn\u2019t enjoy this part of the trip too much, especially Costa Rica. I did meet some people along the way who I did enjoy, and there were plenty of good times. However, in general, I found that I have a better time living with locals and experiencing real culture instead of being around fellow travelers and trying to figure out what are the best things (aka, the touristy things) to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I prefer the simple things. I\u2019m not into touristy towns, events, or activities. I enjoy walking through markets and streets, taking the bus while exploring, and learning about how people really live. I simply enjoy speaking Spanish. Costa Rica was super touristy, expensive, and seemingly everyone spoke English. Things were not going well in Costa Rica, although I must say it\u2019s a close race between Switzerland and Costa Rica for the most beautiful countries I have been to. \r\n\r\n<p>It was beautiful, but it was not my style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found myself longing to be in Colombia during the Costa Rica and Panama parts of the trip. I had even seriously looked at flights from Costa Rica to Colombia, twice. My return flight departed from Panama City and I was thinking maybe I could fly to Colombia and then work my way back into Panama. It turned out those last minute plane tickets were too expensive, and I would need to tough it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \u201caha moment\u201d was when there was a not too impressive <a href='https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5853154192685386257/5853732706374925106' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Colombian restaurant</a> on the same block as my hostel in San Jose, Costa Rica. It\u2019s a little embarrassing to say, but I got goosebumps when I saw the Colombian flag, and my eyes watered up a bit with excitement. Needless to say, I ate dinner there, and I ordered my favorite food in the whole world, a <a href='https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5853154192685386257/5853732707170772434' target=_blank>Bandeja Paisa</a>. At that point I knew. I knew there was something special about Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Changing My Plans</h2>\r\n<p>After returning from Central America, my decision was not difficult to make. I found out the backpacking life wasn\u2019t exactly my favorite thing in the world, but I also knew I still wanted to check out the other South American countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to change my plans. Instead of travelling for a whole year, I would stay in Colombia for about 5-6 months and then make my way through South America for the rest of the year before ending in Brazil for the <a href='http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/' target=\u201d_blank\u201d>World Cup</a> in June of 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this updated plan, it would give me more time to spend in my beloved Colombia, while also allowing ample time to casually make my way through the other countries on the road to Brazil. Maybe I\u2019ll spend a month here, a month there? Maybe I\u2019ll just spend a few days or weeks in the same areas? Maybe I\u2019ll skip on some countries like Paraguay, Bolivia or Uruguay if time runs short? Who knows? I sure don\u2019t. All I know is that I need a few months devoted solely to stay in Colombia.</p>", "category": 4, "views": 571, "headline": "To settle on Colombia, or to continue country hopping?", "image": "blogposts/Central America.jpg", "title": "Colombia or Latin America", "img_alt": "nicaragua, market, mercado, fruit, exotic fruit, frutas, travel, viajar, Central America", "post_date": "2013-08-21", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Marketplace in Nicaragua"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "<p>As you may have read in <a href=\"http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/post/2/the-south-american-dream\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>The South American Dream</a>, in the first year I\u2019m going to be spending as much time in Colombia as I am in all the other 8 South American countries combined. Many people ask me, why Colombia?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting to know Colombia</h2>\r\n<p>It all started back in May of 2011. I was learning Spanish online through <a href=\"http://livemocha.com\" target=\u201dblank\u201d>Livemocha</a> and was helping native Spanish speakers with English while they were helping me with Spanish. On Livemocha, I quickly found out that 30-40% of the Spanish speakers learning English were from Colombia, and became curious. Why are there so many Colombians compared to the other countries?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After talking with about 3 people, I quickly found out how incredibly <b>friendly</b> Colombians were. Not only were they friendly, but they were just as interested in America as I was towards Colombia. I had grown up travelling in Europe and had been accustomed to other countries not having the best opinions about Americans, so this caught me by surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wondered if it was normal for Colombians to be like this, or was it just a subset of Colombians who were learning English that were super friendly and easy to talk with? The more people I talked to, the more confident I was in the good nature of Colombians as a whole. They have so much pride and love for their country, I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. They are unimaginably happy with life, and it quickly rubbed off on me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might say,\u201dbut look at me, I\u2019m happy with life.\u201d That might be the case, but I guarantee it is different from how Colombians are. It is something unique. It is something I can\u2019t explain. It is something I have talked with many people who have been to Colombia, and they can\u2019t explain it either. The only way to understand is  to go to the country and experience it first hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the summer of 2011 progressed, I began to learn about various Colombian things. I was reading Colombian news from about 4 or 5 different sources. I was reading any Colombian blog I could find. I was listening to Colombian music, making <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/My-Colombian-Cocina/200371653384365\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Colombian food</a>, watching Colombian T.V., drinking Colombian coffee, and admiring Colombian soccer. If it was Colombian, I was interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then I decided to even try a long-distance relationship with a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5689580568741899025/5691379765193281138\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Colombian girl</a>. It was great for about 6 months, but in the end it was just too difficult to sustain living like that and we were both not in positions to move. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The First Date with Colombia</h2>\r\n<p>Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Finally it was December of 2011 and it was time to head to this land that had captivated all my interest for almost 6 months. The excitement and anxiety was through the roof, and it even rivals the excitement I feel today about finally being able to drop everything and move down there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite some scares caused by a 2-hour plane delay which caused me to miss my connecting flight in Houston, I made it to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. I was finally in this dream location I had been reading so much about. My girlfriend at the time, her sister, and her mom picked me up from the airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still remember looking out the glass of the airport doors and seeing them with big smiles on their faces as I came through the door. I still remember the drizzling rain and the glow of lights off the pavement. I remember seeing people walking around in the lively city. I remember being <b>happy</b> and <b>relieved</b> to finally be in this wonderful land I had grown to love. There were so many unexplainable emotions, and that was the happiest I had ever felt. I knew from that day that Colombia would forever have an important impact on my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first trip I spent about a week in Bogot\u00e1 and some of the surrounding cities. We then travelled to the coast and spent a week in places like <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5689580568741899025/5694732741170088258\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Parque Tayrona</a> and the historic city of <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5689580568741899025/5694735963871441714\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Cartagena</a>. I also spent a couple days during New Year\u2019s in a small town outside of Girardot at <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5689580568741899025/5692886555339443362\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Camila\u2019s sister\u2019s house</a>. They had a very different house than we\u2019re accustomed to here, and I <b>loved</b> it. Oh, and they they also had an amazing <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/115132444658419098250/albums/5689580568741899025/5692883672455569954\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>pool</a> to help cool off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Year\u2019s in Girardot with Camila\u2019s family solidified my feelings towards Colombia, and the Colombian culture. Experiencing New Year\u2019s with a <b>real</b> Colombian family and <b>real</b> Colombian culture was an irreplaceable experience. For the second time on the trip, I had felt the happiest I had ever felt. That New Year\u2019s Eve remains my favorite day of my life, and it will be tough to beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>\r\n<p>As amazing as my first trip to Colombia was, it had to come to an end at some point. After two and a half weeks, I boarded the plane returning to the U.S. The next few months were difficult and extremely slow months because of the long-distance relationship as well as my desire to return to Colombia. Every day was a struggle, and I longed so desperately to be back in Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point, I had many ideas going through my head. Should I drop everything and move to Colombia? My custom-built house was less than a year old, I only had 1 year left until I finished my MBA, and I was enjoying my work. But my love for Colombia was enough to seriously consider leaving. In the end I decided to stick it out and wait to finish school. However, I lasted less than 3 months in the U.S. before returning to Colombia during my Spring Break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the second trip didn\u2019t turn out as good as the first trip, but it was not Colombia\u2019s fault. Our relationship ran into some issues and the situation with Camila got a bit dicey. It ended up being a more <i>normal</i> trip to Colombia and living a <i>normal</i> life as opposed to the first trip which was full of adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the trip was still unforgettable, and my love for Colombia only continued to grow. You know something is right when the simple things are the exciting things. Taking a taxi, buying groceries, watching T.V., walking along the street, taking the bus, eating, people watching, and talking. It didn't matter what I was doing, I was always having a great time. I became more familiar with Bogot\u00e1 and became comfortable moving around the city by myself without anyone's aid. I started to learn the streets, neighborhoods, stores, and directions. I started to feel like I belonged there. I started to truly feel <b>Colombian</b>, and it felt fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Broader Horizons</h2>\r\n<p>Yet again, I had to leave behind Colombia, but I knew I would be back. The only question was when. I figured I would come back during winter break and check out other parts of Colombia. I knew I wanted to move to Colombia, but I didn't exactly know where. My plans at the time were to return in December of 2012 and check out a city called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medellin\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Medellin</a> and some areas around it and see if I wanted to move to Medellin or to Bogota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, over the course of a few months I decided to not return to Colombia at that time. It was not because the excitement of Colombia had dwindled, it was because I wanted to broaden my horizons. I decided to check out other Spanish speaking countries before I settled on Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon we\u2019ll find out where I went (Here\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.stepsofatraveler.com/photoalbums/\" target=\u201d_blank\u201d>hint</a>) and what I found out.

I became addicted to Spanish and it became my #1 priority for the next 8 months of my life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using all my free time, I tore through all the Spanish lessons within a month, and began talking to anyone I could find on Livemocha through their chat feature. They pair learners up so that I would talk to native Spanish speakers who were learning English and vice-versa. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s hard to express the change Livemocha caused in my life, and it\u2019s even more difficult to understand. I began learning about different cultures, different countries, and different ways of life. I learned about various Latin American countries and formed an understanding of their people and their way of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day I longed to talk to my Livemocha friends, and some days I would Skype for hours. Those days were the best. I would chat, video chat, talk on the phone, watch TV and movies, listen to music - all in Spanish. Believe it or not, even my dog is now bi-lingual. There has always been something about te language that has made me happy. I\u2019m not sure why. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mood instantly changes when I talk Spanish and I become a completely different person. I become confident instead of timid. I become curious instead of reserved. I often ask myself \u201cwhy can\u2019t I be like this when I talk English?\u201d, and after more than 2 years, I still don\u2019t have the answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to learning Spanish, I had gone through the 2 toughest years of my life. The language saved me - it made me happy when nothing else seemed to do the trick. My best explanation is that Spanish allows me to be who I really am. However, the question \u201cwhy?\u201d still exists. And to that question I have no answer but will be searching for the answer during my travels. Maybe some of you have ideas as to why this is, and I\u2019d love to hear about it in the comments below.</p>\r\n", "category": 3, "views": 364, "headline": "how can language be this powerful?", "image": "blogposts/TeachEnglish_2.jpg", "title": "The Power of Spanish", "img_alt": "Spanish, Colombia, Girardot", "post_date": "2013-08-06", "show_pic": true, "active": true, "img_title": "Teaching Spanish in Girardot Colombia"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "blog.blog", "fields": {"body": "Heading south....for a while\r\n\r\n<h2>Formulating the South American Dream</h2>\r\n<p>We\u2019re all familiar with the American Dream - move to the United States, find a job, move up the ladder, and live a successful life full of opportunity. After a year of learning spanish online and sharing my travel ambitions about South America, my peers dubbed me as having \u201cThe South American Dream\u201d. I wanted to leave my stable, successful life in the United States to embark on a journey through Latin America to discover new cultures, language, and ways of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here I am, roughly 2 years after formulating that dream, and I\u2019m making it reality. Finally. There has been so much thought, research, and anxiety in the past couple years, and I\u2019m so ready to embark on this journey. I\u2019m ready to change the way I live, and truly gain my freedom. Being trapped in a world focused on my career and becoming successful, now is the time to change, and search for true <b>happiness</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Route</h2>\r\n<p>Currently I am in the United States, and I will be leaving at the end of August. In June of 2014 I will be in Brazil for the World Cup. But... what about the 9 months in between? I\u2019ve gone back and forth (and back again!) between a few options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first option was to backpack through South America, starting in Colombia and ending in Brazil. This plan was actually the front-runner as of 6 months ago. I decided to take a quick jaunt through Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama in March to test out backpacking because even though I\u2019ve travelled quite a bit, I had never tried the backpacking thing. Through a mix of <a href='http://couchsurfing.com'>couchsurfing</a>, hostels, and staying with a friend in Managua, I found out that the backpacking thing was not for me. I enjoyed most my time in Nicaragua because I was grounded with a couple Nicaraguan friends and we took day trips out to various places. After I left Managua, I started the actual backpacking thing. It\u2019s not necessarily just \u201cbackpacking\u201d that I don\u2019t like, it\u2019s having to rely on hostels and moving around constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next option was to find a job in my beloved Colombia and live there. I have to admit, this option has been super appealing to me, from the minute I took my first step in Colombia. I knew Colombia would always have a special place in my heart, but that topic I will have a full post dedicated to later! Anyway, the only downside to moving to Colombia was that I was scared. No, not of being kidnapped. No, not of being robbed. No... not of the drugs. All of those things are not prevalent in Colombia, and it is so much more than that, which you will find out through this blog. I was scared of staying! If I settle down in Colombia, I might not get another chance to travel like I have now. I didn\u2019t want that to happen...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the third option, which I developed on my backpacking trip through Central America, is to meet in the middle. My current plan is to live in Colombia for about 5 months and then over the next 4-5 months slowly make my way through South America towards Brazil. I\u2019ll traverse through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and then finally Brazil. The details of this... well, they are non-existent! I have some plans to maybe backpack through Peru in February/March, but other than that, I\u2019m just going to wing it. Total freedom, all day, everyday.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Questions, questions, questions!</h2>\r\n<p>So many questions from my friends and co-workers, which is to be expected. Many of the questions I have been asked repeatedly, and I\u2019m starting to get tired of giving the same answers, however there are only a couple weeks left so I think I will survive.</p>\r\n<h3>What are you going to do with all your stuff?</h3>\r\n<p>Sell it. Get rid of it. Give it to family/friends. This was something I was looking forward to. I am not quite there yet, but I\u2019m getting close. Liberating myself from my material possessions has been a process, but it is almost complete!</p>\r\n<h3>Are you going alone?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes! It would be so hard to embark on a journey like this with someone else, although <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Julia-Diego/358160460931860'>Julia and Diego</a> seem to find a way! The fact is that traveling alone and traveling with someone are completely different. People tend to have high level goals and desires when they travel. For me, right now, I travel to experience other cultures and improve my spanish. If I were to travel with someone, I would <b>greatly</b> hinder both of those goals. We wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in places as easily, and flexibility would be diminished. We would need to decide what to do, where to go, what to eat, and all other decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By going solo, I gain complete freedom and I can do whatever I want at all times. I have some friends in Colombia and Peru that I will meet with along the way, but I will also be making friends during my journey as well. On top of that, I will be with locals more learning about their culture and speaking spanish all the time. To me, it\u2019s a no-brainer. I\u2019m not built to long-term travel with other people, it goes against my goals of travel. Now, if I were going to a beach in the Caribbean for a week, that is different. My goal there would be to share the experience with someone, and in that case I would not mind traveling with someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>But Colombia is so dangerous, aren\u2019t you scared?</h3>\r\n<p>This is a question that really hits home with me, because I have such a soft spot in my heart for the wonderful country of Colombia. It\u2019s been interesting hearing the different opinions of people now that they know my plans. They have conflicting opinions on if I\u2019m making a smart decision or a dumb one. However, almost everyone has the same concerns about Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, no, I\u2019m not scared. This will be the third time that I\u2019ve gone to Colombia, and there is a reason why it is my favorite country out of the 26 that I have been lucky enough to visit so far in my life. The people are <b>amazing</b>. The country is <b>beautiful</b>. The culture is <b>captivating</b>. It pains me to hear these outdated opinions about Colombia, and for that one of my <a href=../overview>Goals</a> is to spread the good word about Colombia. Anyway, I better write my Colombia blog post soon before it comes out in my other posts :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you think of my South American dream and the route I\u2019m choosing to take?

There are many things that I would love to write about, but after much thought, this blog is going to be focused around travelling, high-level life topics, and everyday life in Colombia. Here are my 3 goals:</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Share information about travel throughout South America</h4>\r\n<div class=\"post-indent\">\r\n<p> There are plenty places to read about this topic, but my blog will not just be about traveling. I will be writing many posts about how travel affects life and happiness in general. I want to help people understand the possibility of travelling and invoke thoughts and ideas.</p><br>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Discuss high-level topics on life</h4>\r\n<div class=\"post-indent\">\r\n<p>The topics of happiness and meaning of life have always captivated my interest. Finding meaning in life is something many people struggle with and it changes over time. There is no correct answer and everyone finds happiness and meaning in their lives in their own personal ways. I will discuss how I find happiness and maybe that will shed glimpses of light on fellow readers and followers.</p><br>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Spread the great word about Colombia</h4>\r\n<div class=\"post-indent\">\r\n<p>In 2011 I fell in love with Colombia. The people are the warmest people I have ever met, it is truly incredible. The culture, lifestyle, and people of Colombia completely shocked me, and before I even set a foot in Colombia I knew it would have a huge impact on my life. I couldn't have been more right. The reasons for that I will discuss throughout this blog and hopefully continue to educate people on why it\u2019s important for people to know about the current Colombia and not go by the reputation of pre-2003 Colombia.</p><br>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much more that will be discussed, but those are the high-level topics that the majority of my posts will cover. Over the past couple years I've been thinking about so many things, and I sincerely hope you enjoy them!</p>", "category": 2, "views": 468, "headline": "And the journey begins", "image":
