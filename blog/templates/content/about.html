    <p>My name is Adam Wester and Iâ€™m an avid traveler, ponderer of life, and soccer fan. I gained a sense of travel from a young age when my family and I moved to Moscow, Russia when I was only 9 years old. During holiday seasons we would travel mostly around Europe but also ventured into Egypt and Israel. From a very young age I was exposed to a variety of cultures and ways of life. Those experiences greatly affect who I am today, and what I value in life.</p>
    <p>The stint in Russia lasted only 3 years and then we moved back to the United States. I grew up in the small town of Richland, Washington which is in a vast desert (more specifically a shrub-steppe) on the eastern side of Washington state. My life in Richland was alright for the 16 years I lived there, but something was missing. My exposure to cultures and languages at a young age left a void in my life that I needed to fill. By the age of 24 I realized this when I began to learn Spanish and fell in love with it. Learning Spanish and about Latin American culture made me realize what I was missing to achieve fulfillment in my life. I have never strived to have a simple lifestyle and have always been a curious adventure seeker.</p>
    <p>At the age of 26 I decided to leave behind my life, as many travel bloggers do. However, my story is a little different. The typical case is someone leaves behind what they have with little money to their name and find ways to travel for years. I, on the other hand, did have quite a bit of assets and it wasn't the easiest choice. I left all my material possessions and good job to live a much simpler, more fulfilling life. I am now travelling around South America until after the World Cup in Brazil and then will decide where I want to take my life.</p>
